【第1个问题：What is intrinsic capacity?】
问题相关文本：**Content related to intrinsic capacity:**

- Intrinsic capacity (IC), as a comprehensive measure of an individual’s functional ability, has gained prominence in the framework for healthy aging introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO).
- IC is an overarching domain containing 5 subdomains, namely locomotion, sensory, vitality, psychological capacity, and cognitive capacity.
- Locomotion: balance, walking speed time, and chair-stand test; (2) sensory: vision and hearing impairments; (3) vitality: forced expiratory volume, grip strength, and hemoglobin; (4) psychological capacity: affect the status, sleep quantity, and quality; (5) cognitive capacity: episodic memory test.
- The IC used in this cohort study has been proven to have prognostic value in previous studies.
- The score of IC was estimated by a structural equation model (SEM) that included a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The CFA was based on the subfactors identified from a previous exploratory factor analysis (EFA). A bifactor model (1 general factor and 6 subfactors) was fitted.
- The IC score was standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD. A higher score indicates a stronger capacity to perform valued activities.
- daily internet use is significantly linked to a slower decline in IC over time (marginal effect 1.58, 95% CI 1.03-2.12; P < .001).
- Individuals with moderate and regular internet use frequency exhibit higher levels of maintenance in IC (marginal effect 0.74, 95% CI 0.45-1.03, P < .001).
- the relationship between IC changes and internet use frequency demonstrated a nonlinear inverted U-shaped curve (nonlinear P = .003).
- internet use was positively linked to all subdomains except psychological capacity, with the strong effects on locomotion (marginal effect 1.30, 95% CI 0.58-2.03; P < .001), sensory (marginal effect 1.32, 95% CI 0.60-2.04; P < .001), vitality (marginal effect 1.17, 95% CI 0.65–1.69; P < .001) and cognitive capacity (marginal effect 1.56, 95% CI 0.98-2.13; P < .001).
- Subgroup analysis further revealed that improvements in IC vary based on age and gender.
- mediation analysis denoted that more than 28.78% (95% CI 21.24-40.33) of the observed association is mediated by social participation (P < .001).
- The findings of our research underscore the potential benefits of consistent and moderate internet use in promoting and preserving IC, particularly in cognitive capacity, sensory, vitality, and locomotion.
- The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed a capabilities-based approach to measure healthy aging, which focuses on the intrinsic capacity (IC) of individuals as the composite of all the physical and mental capacities that they can draw on at any point in time. IC reflects the residual biological potential of the organism rather than its impairments or deficits. It is influenced by both individual and contextual factors that enable people to be and do what they value as they age. IC has been validated and tested as a reliable indicator of healthy aging in different populations and settings, and it has been shown to have predictive value for mortality, disability, and quality of life outcomes. IC also provides a holistic and comprehensive framework for assessing and managing the health needs of older people, shifting from a disease-oriented to a function-and-life–oriented approach.
- This study leveraged data from a representative cohort of individuals aged 45 and older across China to investigate the relationship between daily internet use and IC, a multifaceted indicator of healthy aging.
- Specifically, the research aims to delineate how varying patterns of internet engagement influence the physical and mental capacities of this demographic, addressing demographic factors and multiple dimensions of activity.
- By examining these associations, the study seeks to clarify the potential benefits and drawbacks of internet use in preserving or enhancing IC among middle-aged and older adults.
- We observed that daily internet use and increased frequency of use were associated with higher levels of cognitive capacity, sensory function, vitality, and locomotion. The results of our study underscore the potential advantages of maintaining a moderate and regular pattern of internet use in promoting and preserving IC.
- Our study assessed the association between daily internet use and IC, extending beyond the focus of previous research on frailty, resilience, and aging. IC provides a comprehensive measure of overall health status, facilitating early interventions to prevent significant health deteriorations. Unlike other aging concepts, IC emphasizes functional abilities rather than the mere presence or absence of disease. It also considers personal attributes, environmental factors, and their interactions, enabling cross-time, cross-country, and cross-cultural comparisons of healthy aging.
- The lack of a direct positive association between daily internet use and psychological capacity is somewhat unexpected.
- Heterogeneity analysis revealed that the impact of internet use on IC varies based on age and gender.
- The results of the mediation analysis showed that internet use is positively associated with physical exercise behavior and social participation of older people, as well as arthritis or rheumatic diseases, which is consistent with the results of previous research.
- In conclusion, this study aims to investigate the relationship between daily internet usage and IC, an aspect that has not been previously explored. IC serves as a crucial assessment and predictive system for healthy aging, as it reflects individuals’ functional abilities and overall well-being. The results of our study underscore the potential advantages of maintaining a moderate and regular pattern of internet use in promoting and preserving IC, particularly in terms of cognitive capacity, sensory capacity, vitality, and locomotion. The effect may be related to social participation. Consequently, our results offer valuable insights for developing interventions to promote healthy aging among the middle-aged and older adult population.

【第1个问题：What is intrinsic capacity?】
问题相关文本：**Abstract:**  
"Intrinsic capacity (IC), as a comprehensive measure of an individual’s functional ability, has gained prominence in the framework for healthy aging introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO)."

**Introduction:**  
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed a capabilities-based approach to measure healthy aging, which focuses on the intrinsic capacity (IC) of individuals as the composite of all the physical and mental capacities that they can draw on at any point in time. IC reflects the residual biological potential of the organism rather than its impairments or deficits. It is influenced by both individual and contextual factors that enable people to be and do what they value as they age. IC has been validated and tested as a reliable indicator of healthy aging in different populations and settings, and it has been shown to have predictive value for mortality, disability, and quality of life outcomes. IC also provides a holistic and comprehensive framework for assessing and managing the health needs of older people, shifting from a disease-oriented to a function-and-life–oriented approach."

**Methods:**  
"The IC used in this cohort study has been proven to have prognostic value in previous studies. IC is an overarching domain containing 5 subdomains, namely locomotion, sensory, vitality, psychological capacity, and cognitive capacity. [...] A higher score indicates a stronger capacity to perform valued activities."

【第2个问题：According to this paper, what negative impacts does the use of the Internet have on the elderly?】
问题相关文本：However, internet use may also have negative consequences for the health of older people, such as increasing the risk of internet addiction, depression, cognitive decline, sleep disturbance, social isolation, and visual impairment [12-14].  
Previous research has indeed shown that internet use may reduce symptoms of depression [9,15], yet it also may negatively affect sleep quality [15], which is crucial for psychological well-being.  
In our study, sleep quality and duration emerged as significant factors influencing psychological capacity, particularly among older adults, who often face sleep-related challenges [35]. We hypothesize that while the internet might offer some psychological benefits, its usage can also lead to poor sleep habits, such as staying up late [36].  
Prolonged internet usage or mood fluctuations induced by internet content may lead to detrimental cycles not conducive to the mental health of older adults with preexisting sleep issues [39].  
Regarding social participation, some researchers believe that when using the internet to chat with strangers, they tend to stay away from their families and reduce social activities, resulting in dissatisfaction with life [12,43].

**From ABSTRACT:**  
*None directly addressing dependency*  

**From INTRODUCTION:**  
"In terms of the effect of depression level on Internet use, **people with the disease will be more dependent on Internet use** (Ye et al., 2O23)."  

"Individuals with high levels of depressive symptoms tend to be concerned about online safety and lack of trust online (Bernard et al., 2019), and the psychological barriers caused by information overload can cause information seekers to stop searching online (Swar et al., 2O17)."  

**From RESULTS:**  
"For Internet use time and depressive symptoms, [...] higher levels of depression at T1 significantly predicted **less Internet use time** at T2 $( \beta = - 0 . 0 3 1 , P = 0 . 0 0 1$ )."  

**From DISCUSSION:**  
"Higher levels of depression were associated with shorter Internet use, and this may be related to the ability to use the Web in individuals with high levels of depression. **People with depression are more likely to experience barriers when using digital technology**, which is related to their social cognitive deficits (Bernard et al.,2Ol9)."

【第10个问题：What is propensity score matching?】
问题相关文本：Propensity score matching (PSM) is a statistical technique that matches individuals based on their probability of receiving a specific treatment or intervention, while accounting for the factors that affect this probability.  
This research employs propensity score matching (PSM) to balance the characteristics of individuals who use the internet and those who do not.  
By utilizing PSM, this study aims to reduce sample selection bias and improve the precision of determining the causal link between internet use and health results.  
PSM analysis typically involves two main steps: The initial step entails computing the propensity score and then matching subjects based on this score.  
The propensity score, derived from a logit regression model, is utilized to match subjects from the Internet use group and non-usage group under comparable circumstances.  
It is estimated as follows:  
$$P = P ( D = 1 | x ) = \frac { 1 } { 1 + e ^ { - \beta _ { 0 } } - \sum \beta _ { i } x _ { i } }$$  
The secondly analysis is to estimate the Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT) by the following model, which reflects the effect of using internet on the emotional, physical and cognitive health of older adults:  
$$\begin{array} { r } { A T T = E ( Y _ { 1 } | D = 1 ) - E ( Y _ { 0 } | D = 1 ) = E ( Y _ { 1 } | D = 1 , P ) } \\ { - E ( Y _ { 0 } | D = 0 , P ) } \end{array}$$  
In order to test the robustness of PSM, various matching methods are generally used. In our study, we used four matching methods: nearest neighbor matching, kernel matching, optimal matching and radius matching in all.  
Using PSM, 454 older adults in the internet use group were matched with 2020 older adults in the non-internet use group based on twelve covariates, resulting in 410 participants in each group.  
The nearest-neighbor matching method (1:1) was employed, resulting in a total of 410 pairs of successfully matched samples.  
Following matching, the independent sample $t$ -test for each covariate between the internet-using and non-using groups no longer showed significant differences $( p > 0 . 0 5 )$ ).  
The common support hypothesis, as proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin, posits that the propensity score ranges of groups using the internet and not using the internet should be similar.  
The bootstrap method was utilized to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and empirical standard error post propensity score matching.  
To verify the robustness of the nearest neighbor matching method (1:1), we used optimal matching, kernel matching using normal density, and radius $( \mathrm { c a l i p e r } \ = \ 0 . 0 5 )$ ) to conduct the PSM.  
The results of propensity score matching analysis revealed a positive impact of internet use on both physical and emotional health.  
In this study, propensity score matching was used to address sample selection bias and control for confounding factors.  
Our study employed PSM to balance the characteristics of internet users and non-users.  
The discrepancies in these findings may stem from insufficient control over confounding variables in earlier studies.
回答10答案：Propensity score matching (PSM) is a statistical technique that matches individuals based on their probability of receiving a specific treatment or intervention, while accounting for the factors that affect this probability.

【第11个问题：What is mindfulness?】
问题相关文本：Mindfulness refers to focusing attention on the present moment in a conscious and nonjudgmental way. Mindfulness can be conceptualized as a momentary state, a stable trait (the tendency to be mindful in daily life), or an intervention method. Mindfulness is assessed via the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM), which evaluates trait mindfulness. The intervention design adhered to fundamental principles of mindfulness, with training activities centered around core exercises such as "Beyond automatic pilot," "Coming home to the present: Gathering the scattered mind," "Allowing things to be as they already are," and "Kindness in action." Key intervention targets included:
- Understanding what mindfulness is
- Perceiving the present moment
- Differentiating between thinking and awareness
- Reducing excessive rumination
- Identifying mind wandering
- Gathering the scattered mind to enhance direct experience
- Recognizing aversion and confronting negative experiences
- Allowing things to be as they are
- Seeing thoughts as thoughts (distinguishing thoughts from facts)
- Improving positive emotions and cognitive styles through kindness in action.
回答11答案：focusing attention on the present moment in a conscious and nonjudgmental way

【第12个问题：What is the view of the displacement hypothesis of mobile phone use?】
问题相关文本：The displacement hypothesis of mobile phone use (Kushlev & Leitao, 2020) posits that mobile phone use occupies individuals’ time and attention that could otherwise be devoted to other activities such as sleep, physical exercise, and offline interpersonal interaction, thereby impacting their physical and mental health.

Numerous studies have provided support for the displacement hypothesis. Research has demonstrated that phubbing behavior, which involves snubbing someone in a social setting by focusing on one’s phone rather than engaging in direct conversation with the person present, can have a detrimental impact on individuals’ relationships with their significant others (Chotpitayasunondh & Douglas, 2018; Roberts & David, 2016). Higher levels of problematic mobile phone use are associated with greater levels of sleep interference (procrastination in bedtime scheduling), leading to more significant sleep disorders (e.g., Correa-Iriarte, Hidalgo-Fuentes, & Martí-Vilar, 2023; Cui et al., 2021; Hamvai et al., 2023).

These findings indicate that decreasing problematic mobile phone use may help enhance adolescents’ physical and mental health. Thus, alleviating adolescent depression and sleep disorders by reducing problematic mobile phone use is highly important. Our research findings not only align with previous empirical studies but also support the displacement hypothesis and interference hypothesis of mobile phone use (Kushlev & Leitao, 2020; Sbarra et al., 2019).
回答12答案：Mobile phone use occupies individuals’ time and attention that could otherwise be devoted to other activities such as sleep, physical exercise, and offline interpersonal interaction, thereby impacting their physical and mental health.

The reliability coefficients (alpha) for each factor are 0.841, 0.793, 0.749 and 0.758, respectively, all indicating reliability above 0.7, ensuring the reliability of the data.  
We performed convergent and discriminant validity tests. All CR values are greater than or equal to 0.5, indicating that there are no data reliability issues.  
Test validations were performed to assess how newly developed scales or tests aligned with other relevant scales or tests (convergent validity) and simultaneously differentiate them from measures of different constructs (discriminant validity). Specifically, the aim was to confirm that different scales measuring the same construct aligned with each other and were simultaneously distinct from scales measuring different constructs. These validations were carried out to evaluate the validity of the measurement tools or tests and to ensure reliability. As a result of these tests, the newly generated scale demonstrated high alignment with existing scales, indicating convergent validity. At the same time, it exhibited discrimination from measures of different constructs. Based on these results, the scale adopted in this study can be considered effective for further analysis.  
The tools used are IBM SPSS v26 and AMOS v26. Boots trap was used 5,000 times. The respective values for the validity of the SEM are chi-square/degrees of freedom of 1.560 (chi-square = 111.383, df = 71), GFI is 0.948 (> 0.9), AGFI is 0.922 (> 0.9), CFI is 0.975 (> 0.9), and RMSEA is 0.045 (< 0.08), within each limit. This means that the model is valid.
回答36答案：Cronbach’s alpha coefficient above 0.7 ensures the reliability of the data.

【第42个问题：what is framing effect?】
问题相关文本：The framing effect is one of the most valuable approaches to investigating decisional biases and influencing factors in medical decision-making. The framing effect was labeled by Tversky and Kahneman as the occurrence of changes in preferences (risk-seeking vs risk-averse) as a result of different descriptions of the same problem. Physicians’ preference for alternative therapies shifted depending on whether the outcomes were framed in terms of the probability of “living” or the probability of “dying.” In the mass media, by transmitting the importance of a specific aspect of reality, framing can influence the perception of audience members. People’s risk perception and feelings (ie, worry) would be influenced when different frames (eg, risk amplifying description frame and risk attenuating description frame) are used. We developed 16 frames to present the pandemic information by using a 2 (domain: living [good news] vs dying [bad news]) × 2 (count: absolute vs relative) × 2 (population base: excluding population base vs including population base) × 2 (content: text-only vs text-plus-graphic) mixed factorial design. Participants were more willing to forward good news (eg, cures) than bad news (eg, deaths). When reporting bad news, the inclusion of the “population base” was effective in minimizing negative emotions. When reporting good news, excluding the “population base” was more effective than including it in order to maximize positive emotions. A text-plus-graphic frame worked better than a text-only frame in lowering the level of risk perception and negative emotions. Reporting pandemic information by using absolute count and/or the text-plus-graphic format could nudge people into lowering the level of risk perception and the negative emotion induced by bad news, raising the positive emotion induced by good news, while including the population base can lower the negative emotion induced by bad news, the positive emotion induced by good news, and the level of risk perception. The resultant findings demonstrate that the framing effect occurs on a large scale: When the pandemic information is represented by eight “logically equivalent” frames, people’s risk perceptions, emotional responses, and even their willingness to forward a message clearly varies, contrary to the assumption of description invariance. The framing effect can also be influenced by the graphical representation of options. Representing information in the “text-plus-graphic” format works better than the “text-only” format in lowering the levels of risk perception/negative emotion, although with very small effect sizes.

【第43个问题：what questionnaires were used in the study?】
问题相关文本：# Executive Functions  
- "The child’s primary teacher completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF; Gioia et al., 2010)."  
- "The BRIEF-Teacher version contains 86 items tapping inhibition, shifting, initiation, planning, organizing, monitoring, emotional control, and working memory. Questions are rated on a 3-point scale ranging from \(0 = \mathrm{never}\), \(1 = \mathrm{sometimes}\), to \(2 = \mathrm{often}\)."  

# Conscientiousness  
- "At ages 10, 12, 14, and 16, the Norwegian version of the self-reported Big Five Inventory was applied to assess conscientiousness (Soto et al., 2008), by capturing the extent to which the individual is diligent, careful, responsible, organized, goal-directed and follows norms and rules. [...] Response options range from \(1 = \mathrm{disagree}\) to \(5 = \mathrm{agree}\) and nine items are scored."  
- "Effortful control was assessed at age 6 by the short version of the parent-reported Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (Rothbart et al., 2001). [...] The effortful control measure contains 26 items [...] rated on a 7-point Likert scale \([1 = \mathrm{extremely\ untrue\ of\ your\ child}, 7 = \mathrm{extremely\ true\ of\ your\ child}]\)."  

# Perceived Athletic Competence (PAC)  
- "Children completed the Self-Description Questionnaire I (SDQ-I; Marsh et al., 1984) at ages 6, 8, and 10. We utilized the physical abilities subscale [...] consisting of eight items, such as 'I can run fast,' rated on a 5-point scale \(\scriptstyle1 = \mathrm{false}, 5 = \mathrm{true}\)."

【第44个问题：According to the study, what is the relationship between executive function and PA and sedentary time?】
问题相关文本：Based on the provided text, here are all sentences directly related to the relationship between executive function, physical activity (PA), and sedentary time:

1.  "Executive functions (teacher report), effortful control/conscientiousness (parent and self-report), and PAC (self-report) constituted the predictors." (Method section)
2.  "Changes in executive functions were unrelated to future changes in PA and sedentary time." (Results section)
3.  "Executive functions neither predicted PA nor sedentary time at the within-person level." (Discussion section)
4.  "Finding changes in conscientiousness to predict changes in total PA and MVPA aligns with previous research... Our finding is in accordance with the results of a study... revealing no prospective relation between conscientiousness and self-reported sitting time." (Discussion section - Context for EF null finding via conscientiousness comparison)
5.  "Changes in executive functions did not predict changes in PA or sedentary time at the within-person level." (Discussion section)
6.  "Multiple studies of children and adolescents chronicle cross-sectional correlations between executive functions and these outcomes... but results are mixed... The present study mirrors these mixed results, with executive functioning correlating with PA only for a minority of time points showing no real consistency or pattern... In sum, our study lends no support to a causal relation between executive functions and PA or sedentariness." (Discussion section)
7.  "Of note, higher executive functions are considered a cognitive basis for self-regulation... Conscientiousness may therefore have accounted for the potential predictions from executive functioning, thus explaining the null-finding." (Discussion section - Explanation for null finding)
8.  "Finally, executive functions were reported by teachers which may have lower validity than performance-based tests of executive functions." (Limitations section)

【第45个问题：define affect regulation】
问题相关文本："affect regulation (i.e., modifying how we experience and react to emotions; Gross & Thompson, 2007)."  
"Gratz and Roemer (2004) defined affect regulation difficulties via six facets: nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal pursuit in the face of negative emotions, difficulty controlling impulses in the face of negative emotions, lack of emotional awareness, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of knowledge about the emotions being experienced."  
"The process model of emotion regulation identifies two major strategies: cognitive reappraisal and suppression (Gross, 2002)."  
"Cognitive reappraisal 'involves construing a potentially emotion-eliciting situation in a way that changes its emotional impact' (Gross & John, 2003, p. 349)."  
"Affect regulation has been studied for stress, relationships, and psychological well-being (Amat et al., 2005; Gross et al., 2019; Niven et al., 2012)."  
"effective affect regulation strategies such as cognitive reappraisal (Webb, Miles, & Sheeran, 2012) could hold promise for health behavior change."  
"Leventhal et al.’s (2016) Common Sense Model proposed that cognitive reappraisal influences behavioral responses to health threats."  
"Affect regulation can also attenuate the impact of automatic influences on behavior (Hofmann et al., 2009)."  
"People can modulate anticipated affect—and thus influence health behaviors—through affect regulation."  
"the capacity to downregulate anticipated positive affect from unhealthy behaviors, and upregulate anticipated positive affect from healthy behaviors."  
"cognitive reappraisal alters emotional experiences by regulating the person’s emotional response (Gross, 2002)."  
"people who are better at regulating their affect (i.e., exhibit less difficulty in regulating affect and greater use of cognitive reappraisal)."  
"difficulties in emotion regulation were operationalized with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)."  
"Reappraisal was measured using the six-item reappraisal subscale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire."  
"Greater use of cognitive reappraisal was associated with higher intentions to engage in health behaviors."

【第47个问题：what is cognitive reappraisal】
问题相关文本：Cognitive reappraisal “involves construing a potentially emotion-eliciting situation in a way that changes its emotional impact” and is measured using the reappraisal subscale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.  
Cognitive reappraisal alters emotional experiences by regulating the person’s emotional response.  
The use of reappraisal lowers expectations that substances would lead to improved mood.  
Thus, the capacity to downregulate anticipated positive affect from unhealthy behaviors, and upregulate anticipated positive affect from healthy behaviors, should promote healthful intentions and behaviors through increasing the favorability of health-related attitudes.  
Reappraisal could enable people to better calibrate social influences on health behaviors (norms) and regulate their confidence about, or the perceived ease of, engaging in health behaviors (PBC).  
Cognitive reappraisal enhances intentional control of behavior and attenuates the influence of habit.  
Reappraisal alters intentional versus habitual control of health behaviors.  
Reappraisal enables individuals to downregulate negative affect and upregulate positive affect.  
Using affect regulation strategies could help people change the valence or influence of health cognitions, thereby promoting healthful intentions and behavior.  
Reappraisal facilitates conscious deliberation (e.g., analytical thinking), and thus can override automatic habitual responses.  
Reappraisal interventions have been effective in reducing alcohol consumption and smoking and food cravings.

【第49个问题：Is the health behavior in Study 2 the same as in Study 1】
问题相关文本：Study 1 tested whether difficulties with affect regulation are associated with lower health-related behavioral intentions. Study 2 introduces the Calibrate and Qualify Model to examine the role of cognitive reappraisal in predicting health-related intentions and behavior.  
Study 1 was a cross-sectional study of 15 health behaviors \((N\!=\!319)\) that measured reasoned action approach (RAA) variables and difficulties in emotion regulation. Study 2 was a 3-month longitudinal study \((N\!=\!807)\) of eight health-related behaviors that tested the Calibrate and Qualify Model predictions using measures of cognitive reappraisal, RAA variables, and habit.  
Study 1 uses a cross-sectional design to test whether people who have difficulties regulating their affect—as measured by the DERS—exhibit lower intentions to perform 15 health-related behaviors.  
Study 2 is a longitudinal analysis that assesses cognitions, intentions, habits, and behavioral performance for eight health behaviors across a 3-month period.  
Study 1 showed that lack of access to affect regulation strategies negatively impacted intentions. Thus, in Study 2, we examine whether cognitive reappraisal—a particularly effective regulation strategy—promotes health-related intentions and behaviors.  
Study 2 evaluated the longitudinal influence of reappraisal on health intentions and behavior.  
Study 1 showed that difficulties in affect regulation predicted lower intentions to perform 15 health-related behaviors. Accordingly, Study 2 investigated the role of cognitive reappraisal in predicting intentions and behavior over 3 months using the Calibrate and Qualify Model.  
Study 1 examined 15 health behaviors with a cross-sectional design. Study 2 tracked 8 behaviors longitudinally over 3 months.  
The behaviors in Study 1 included physical activity, low-fat diet, eating fruits and vegetables, use of sunscreen, floss teeth, drinking four or more cups of coffee each day, using illegal drugs, taking multivitamins, exceeding speed limit when driving, drinking more than recommended daily limits of alcohol, smoking cigarettes, snacking between meals, attending annual dental checkups, weighing oneself each week, and taking prescribed medicine.  
Study 2 focused on physical activity, flossing, eating fruits and vegetables, eating a low-fat diet, avoid snacking, avoid drinking more than the recommended weekly limit of alcohol, avoid continuous sitting, and avoid eating more than two portions of red meat per week.  
Study 2 includes a measure of habit.  
Study 1 measured behavioral intention. Study 2 measured behavioral performance at follow-up.

【第51个问题：what is LGB people】
问题相关文本：Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people disproportionately experience worse outcomes across various health domains.  
Stigma—negative feelings, perceptions, or treatment based on marginalized group identity—manifests at multiple levels.  
Lesbian/gay adults are grouped as having same-gender attraction (e.g., same-gender loving).  
Bisexual/pansexual adults are grouped as having multigender attraction (e.g., pansexual).  
Bisexual and pansexual individuals (people who have multigender attraction) face additional stressors associated with their sexual identity.  
Bisexuals experience elevated minority stress and report worse health outcomes compared to lesbian and gay people.  
Bisexual/pansexual people report stigma and hostility from both heterosexual and lesbian/gay people due to their sexual orientation.  
Bisexual/pansexual people are less open and more likely to conceal their sexual orientation compared to lesbian/gay people and have a weaker sense of connection to the LGB community.  
Lesbian/gay people may have developed adaptive responses brought on by a history of stigma-related stress.  
When lesbian/gay people are fully supported and connected to their community, they develop a sense of identity pride.

【第52个问题：what is EMA】
问题相关文本：Ecological momentary assessment study using a digital platform on eligible smartphones that had an embedded optic sensor to measure physiological responses. Participants were prompted three times daily to provide perceptions of stress, psychological well-being, blood pressure, heart rate, and recent health behaviors. This study seeks to address these limitations by examining the affective, physiological, and behavioral experiences as they relate to daily stress by sexual orientation in naturalistic contexts. We designed the study as an ecological momentary assessment study in which participants were instructed to complete three check-ins each day for a period of 21 days. The check-ins were completed in the morning, afternoon, and evening following random notifications within the specified time window. At each check-in, participants were instructed to place their finger over the optic sensor for approximately 30 s, which measured their HR and BP. Following this, they were presented with questions regarding their current stress, coping, and emotions. Prior to beginning the ecological momentary assessment portion of the study, participants provided their age and their race and ethnicity. During each check-in, participants recorded their HR and BP using the optic sensor on their phone. After recording their HR and BP, participants were asked whether they had experienced any particularly stressful event since the last check-in. Using a digital platform we examined almost 30,000 people with more than 300,000 check-ins to assess stress, emotion, and physiology in their daily lives. Se incitó a los participantes tres veces al día que proporcionaran percepciones sobre el estrés, el bienestar psicológico, la presión arterial, la frecuencia cardíaca y los comportamientos de salud recientes.

【第54个问题：what is Psychological Resilience】
问题相关文本：Despite several indices of poor health, LGB adults demonstrate some elements of psychological and physical resilience that may have long-term health effects.  
These results suggest that while stigma may shape how sexual minorities perceive and respond to stress, it does not altogether result in markers that reflect poorer health and point to the resilience of sexual minorities.  
Rather, lesbian/gay people may have developed adaptive responses brought on by a history of stigma-related stress making them resilient to future stressors.  
There is a growing body of research identifying unique personal and collective strengths allowing gay/lesbian people to thrive in the face of social adversity.  
The results of this study highlight those most at risk for negative consequences of stress and also the resilience of LGB people.  
A pesar de varios índices de mala salud, los adultos LGB demuestran algunos elementos de resiliencia psicológica y física que pueden tener efectos en la salud a largo plazo.

【第59个问题：what is SMM】
问题相关文本：Sexual minority men (SMM), including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, are disproportionately affected by health inequities.  
SMM are disproportionately affected by health inequities. One reason may be that health care providers hold implicit sexual health stereotypes that associate SMM with sexually transmitted infections and that they manifest in implicit bias-in-action—implicit stereotypes influence diagnoses and management recommendations of SMM patients in health care settings.  
Strong implicit sexual health stereotypes predicted less correct diagnoses and management recommendations only in the case study in which the male patient had been sexually involved with a male partner.  
Our research suggests that health care providers’ implicit bias-in-action may be one causal reason underlying the health inequities that disproportionately target SMM.  
Furthermore, educating health care providers about the potential of implicit bias-in-action in health care settings can circumvent the influential role of implicit stereotypes in diagnoses and management recommendations, thus improving the quality of provider–patient health care encounters.  
SMM experience disproportionate comorbidities including substance use disorders, depression, psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicides.  
SMM rate their overall well-being low on measures of socioeconomic and stress factors.  
Inequities in health outcomes among SMM (and sexual and gender minority populations in general) are persistent.  
Given their health, social, and well-being needs, it is vital for SMM to have access to high-quality encounters with their health care providers.  
SMM report unfair treatment during health care interactions.  
Perceptions and experiences of unfairness and discrimination in health care can contribute to the health inequities that disproportionately target SMM.  
It is widely believed in public health that SMM’s unfair health care experiences are due (at least in part) to implicit and explicit biases in the minds of health care providers.  
The main goal of the current research is to assess the implicit bias construct of sexual health stereotypes about SMM and, for the first time, to experimentally test its role in diagnoses and management recommendations for an SMM (relative to a non-SMM) patient.  
NPPAs [nurse practitioners and physician assistants] are increasingly providing care, including to SMM, and thus becoming a critical cadre to target for improving health care encounters for SMM.  
NPPAs can be affirming for their SMM patients, but they, similar to other health providers, are likely to hold implicit biases that shape their clinical practice to the detriment of their SMM patients.  
The present research extends the past literature by targeting implicit bias-in-action... its negative role in NPPAs’ diagnoses and management recommendations... for SMM patients.  
Implicit health stereotypes may be a pathway to impacting health care providers’ behavioral decisions related to diagnoses and management recommendations for SMM patients.  
The present research assesses NPPAs’ implicit STI-related stereotypes about SMM. We expect that NPPAs will demonstrate a stronger automatic association between SMM and STIs relative to heterosexual persons and STIs.  
Most importantly, we test an implicit bias-in-action hypothesis—that stronger implicit sexual health stereotypes about SMM will be related to NPPAs’ unfair diagnoses and management recommendations for an SMM (relative to non-SMM) patient.  
NPPAs’ treatment of SMM patients may be specifically rooted in implicit negative stereotypes about SMM’s sexual health behaviors (e.g., promiscuous) and outcomes (e.g., STIs).  
The current research addresses a gap in the literature by documenting... the implicit sexual health stereotypes held by NPPAs about SMM and whether these stereotypes are related to NPPAs’ health care diagnoses and management recommendations of an SMM patient.  
Hypothesis 1: NPPAs will exhibit implicit sexual health stereotypes about SMM relative to heterosexual persons.  
Hypothesis 2: NPPAs’ implicit sexual health stereotypes about SMM will be related to incorrect diagnoses and management recommendations targeting an SMM patient.  
Explicit bias against SMM men may also be related to incorrect diagnoses and management recommendations targeting an SMM patient.  
NPPA participants exhibited moderate levels of implicit sexual health stereotypes.  
Stronger implicit sexual health stereotypes were associated with less correct diagnoses and management recommendations only in the case study in which the male patient had been sexually involved with a male partner.  
This effect persisted after testing the role of explicit attitudes toward gay men, which also independently predicted less correct diagnoses and management recommendations.  
These are the first data of their kind to suggest that implicit health stereotypes may be a pathway to impacting health care providers’ behavioral decisions related to diagnoses and management recommendations for SMM patients.  
Our NPPA participants exhibited implicit bias-in-action. These novel findings... suggest that implicit bias plays an independent role in health care with SMM patients.  
NPPA participants’ implicit sexual health stereotypes about SMM may negatively contribute to diagnoses and management recommendations.  
Improving the quality of NPPA–SMM patient health care encounters is a vital health care issue.  
Bias against SMM and gender and sexual minority groups in general is a systemic issue in health care.  
The current findings suggest specific and new recommendations for NPPA training and curriculum; specifically, a systemic change to curricula that includes educating providers about implicit bias-in-action in health care encounters with SMM.  
Educating NPPAs about the potential of implicit bias-in-action in health care settings can circumvent the influential role of implicit sexual health stereotypes in NPPAs’ diagnoses and management recommendations.  
Implicit bias-in-action is malleable to the extent that the behavioral consequences of implicit biases (presently, diagnoses and management recommendations for SMM) can be altered.

【第60个问题：what is NPPA】
问题相关文本：NPPA refers to nurse practitioner and physician assistant professionals and trainees.  
The present experiment tests an implicit bias-in-action hypothesis with a sample of nurse practitioner and physician assistant (NPPA) professionals and trainees.  
NPPA participants completed a measure of implicit sexual health stereotypes, and then provided diagnoses and management recommendations for a male patient presented with a sexually transmitted infection and a history of having been sexually involved with either a new male or female partner.  
NPPA participants exhibited implicit bias-in-action.  
We address our main research goal with a sample of nurse practitioners and physician assistants (NPPAs).  
Within the larger health care system in the United States, NPPAs are increasingly providing primary, secondary, and tertiary care, including to SMM, and thus becoming a critical cadre to target for improving health care encounters for SMM.  
NPPAs are central to the patient care team and work at hospitals, outpatient centers, doctors’ offices, emergency rooms, and urgent care centers and have many different specialties.  
NPPAs can be affirming for their SMM patients, but they, similar to other health providers, are likely to hold implicit biases that shape their clinical practice to the detriment of their SMM patients.  
The present research assesses NPPAs’ implicit STI-related stereotypes about SMM.  
We expect that NPPAs will demonstrate a stronger automatic association between SMM and STIs relative to heterosexual persons and STIs.  
Most importantly, we test an implicit bias-in-action hypothesis—that stronger implicit sexual health stereotypes about SMM will be related to NPPAs’ unfair diagnoses and management recommendations for an SMM (relative to non-SMM) patient.  
Understanding NPPAs’ implicit bias-in-action in health care is important for two reasons.  
The current research addresses a gap in the literature by documenting, for the first time, the implicit sexual health stereotypes held by NPPAs about SMM and whether these stereotypes are related to NPPAs’ health care diagnoses and management recommendations of an SMM patient.  
Hypothesis 1: NPPAs will exhibit implicit sexual health stereotypes about SMM relative to heterosexual persons.  
Hypothesis 2: NPPAs’ implicit sexual health stereotypes about SMM will be related to incorrect diagnoses and management recommendations targeting an SMM patient.  
A sample of 111 NPPA professionals and trainees in the United States completed the procedure of the study (entitled “The Healthcare Project”) in exchange for a $25 gift card.  
The results of a one-sample t test demonstrate that the NPPA professional and trainee participants exhibited, on average, a moderate level of implicit sexual health stereotypes.  
As reported and summarized in Table 3, after controlling for the demographic variables, cultural competence, and subjective case knowledge, the bootstrap results showed that NPPA professional and trainee participants with stronger implicit sexual health stereotypes were more likely to provide more incorrect diagnoses and management recommendations in the case vignette in which the male patient had a sexual history with a male sexual partner (i.e., the SMM patient) than those with weaker (or no) implicit sexual health stereotypes.  
The present research tested an implicit bias-in-action hypothesis with a sample of NPPA professionals and trainees who completed a new measure of implicit sexual health stereotypes and provided diagnoses and management recommendations for a male patient presented with an STI and a history of having been sexually involved with either a new male or female partner.  
NPPA participants exhibited moderate levels of implicit sexual health stereotypes.  
Regardless of their training, presently operationalized as participants’ perception of their knowledge related to the case study, cultural competence education and experience, and explicit attitudes toward gay men, our NPPA participants exhibited implicit bias-in-action.  
In 2022, 82% of nursing professionals identified as female, and 64% of physician assistants identified as female.  
Because most of the study’s participants were female, the present results may be an underestimation of the implicit sexual health stereotypes in the larger population of NPPAs.  
We were unable to examine the interaction of NPPAs’ gender and implicit bias-in-action because of the relatively small sample size as a function of gender.  
Our study measured diagnoses and management recommendations using case study vignettes, which may not be representative of how this sample of NPPA professionals and trainees would behave in a real-world health care setting.  
Notwithstanding the above limitations, our data provide the first evidence in support of NPPAs’ implicit bias-in-action—NPPAs’ implicit sexual health stereotypes about SMM may negatively contribute to diagnoses and management recommendations.  
However, the empirical literature on NPPAs’ implicit bias-in-action and its underlying mechanisms are virtually nonexistent.  
It is important to uncover this knowledge because NPPAs are the largest segment of the health care workforce and a quickly growing segment of the workforce and patient advocates.  
The present findings move this issue forward by increasing the scientific understanding of health care services NPPAs provide to SMM patients.  
The current findings suggest specific and new recommendations for NPPA training and curriculum; specifically, a systemic change to curricula that includes educating providers about implicit bias-in-action in health care encounters with SMM.  
Educating NPPAs about the potential of implicit bias-in-action in health care settings can circumvent the influential role of implicit sexual health stereotypes in NPPAs’ diagnoses and management recommendations.  
El presente experimento, el primero de su tipo, pone a prueba una hipótesis de sesgo en acción implícito con una muestra de profesionales y aprendices de enfermeras practicantes y asistentes médicos (NPPA, por sus siglas en inglés).  
Los participantes NPPA completaron una medida de estereotipos implícitos de salud sexual, luego proporcionaron diagnósticos y recomendaciones de manejo para un paciente masculino que presentaba una STI y antecedentes de haber tenido relaciones sexuales con una nueva pareja masculina o femenina.  
Los participantes NPPA exhibieron un sesgo implícito en la acción.

【第61个问题：What are the extraneous variables in statistical analysis】
问题相关文本：The segments containing content related to extraneous variables (controlled variables, confounds) are:

1.  "Also, we tested if empirical support for implicit bias-in-action would persist above and beyond the roles of **subjective competency and knowledge variables and well-studied demographic variables**."
2.  "Finally, explicit bias against SMM men may also be related to incorrect diagnoses and management recommendations targeting an SMM patient (but not those targeting a non-SMM patient), but, consistent with theory and data showing that different biases reflect different mechanisms underlying behaviors, we tested if implicit biasin-action persists even after **accounting for explicit bias**."
3.  "In the first hierarchical linear regression, we first controlled for **demographic factors such as age and gender** $\scriptstyle0\,=\,f e m a l e$ ; $1=m a l e)$ in Step 1."
4.  "We also sought to test the role of implicit sexual health stereotypes in diagnoses and management recommendations after **accounting for participants’ subjective professional training—that is, their experience with working with gay men (cultural competence) and their subjective knowledge about the specific case—and explicit attitudes toward gay men**, so we controlled for these variables in Step 1 as well."

12. "First, female NPPA professionals and trainees were overrepresented... **Research shows, and our data replicate, that women sometimes hold less antigay bias than men** (Banse et al., 2001; Herek, 1988), and because most of the study’s participants were female, the present results may be an underestimation of the implicit sexual health stereotypes in the larger population of NPPAs. Second, and related, **we were unable to examine the interaction of NPPAs’ gender and implicit bias-in-action** because of the relatively small sample size as a function of gender."
13. "Third, **as opposed to examining implicit bias-in-action in an actual health care setting**, our study measured diagnoses and management recommendations using case study vignettes, which may not be representative of how this sample of NPPA professionals and trainees would behave in a real-world health care setting." (Highlights a potential confound between method and real-world behavior).
14. "Fourth, **the current research investigates the implicit sexual health stereotype that SMM are associated with STIs, but the research on explicit sexual health stereotypes has demonstrated that SMM are also associated with promiscuity, risky sexual behaviors, and hypersexuality** (Calabrese et al., 2018; Golub et al., 2017; Ross, 2002; Watts & O’Byrne, 2019). Future research should test if these stereotypes are also automatically (implicitly) activated and if they shape implicit bias-in-action."

【第64个问题：what is the difference between STI and HIV】
问题相关文本：Based on the provided text segments, all sentences directly related to the difference between STIs and HIV are as follows:

1.  "**there are several ways that GBM may mitigate their risk for STI/HIV transmission when engaging in anal sex with multiple partners (including, but not limited to, using condoms or using preexposure prophylaxis).**" (Explicitly contrasts STI and HIV transmission risk/mitigation)
2.  "**Examining whether there is a link between intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors and observable health outcomes, like recent bacterial STI diagnosis, may therefore be more informative...**" (Specifies bacterial STI as the health outcome examined, distinct from HIV)
3.  "**Finally, there was a significant association between intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors and recent bacterial STI diagnosis $(O R\,{=}\,1.68,p\,{<}\,.001,95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}\,[1.30$ 0, 2.16]).**" (Reports the specific finding linking intrusive thoughts to bacterial STI diagnosis)
4.  "**Recent STI Diagnosis. Bacterial STI diagnosis (Chlamydia or Gonorrhea) within the P6M was derived from two sources of data... A binary variable was created that indicates if participants had a positive STI test result...**" (Defines the specific STIs measured - bacterial, Chlamydia/Gonorrhea - distinct from HIV)
5.  "**We examined the association between intrusive sexual thoughts/ behaviors (measured at T2) and recent (P6M) bacterial STI diagnosis (measured at T3)...**" (Reiterates the outcome measured was bacterial STI diagnosis)

【第65个问题：How to measure obsessive-compulsive symptoms in research】
问题相关文本：Objective: Among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors (i.e., distress about one’s sexual urges or behaviors) are associated with depression and engagement in behavior that increases the risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

"In the current work, 'intrusive sexual thoughts and behaviors' refers to a preoccupation with one’s sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors to the extent that it interferes with one’s personal and professional life—typically leading to feelings of distress or remorse."

"Intrusive Sexual Thoughts/Behaviors. Intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors were assessed using the 10-item SCS (current α = .89), which was derived from resources for individuals who experience difficulty managing their sexual thoughts and behaviors to the point of experiencing distress (Kalichman & Rompa, 1995, 2001). Participants were asked the extent to which various statements (e.g., 'I think about sex more than I would like to') described them [1 = not at all like me to 4 = very much like me), and item responses were averaged into a single score."

"However, it is important to recognize that the core of this construct is the experience of emotional/psychological distress related to thoughts about or urges to engage in sexual activity. In addition, eight out of the 10 SCS items measure thoughts and feelings, rather than behaviors alone. Indeed, one need not engage in sexual behavior at all to experience sexually intrusive thoughts."

"Keywords: men who have sex with men, social support, minority stress, sexually transmitted infection, Sexual Compulsivity"
回答65答案：Using the 10-item SCS (current α = .89). Participants rated statements (e.g., 'I think about sex more than I would like to') on a scale from 1 = not at all like me to 4 = very much like me. Item responses were averaged into a single score.

【第66个问题：What are the independent variables and mediator variables】
问题相关文本：**Independent Variable:**  
- "internalized homonegativity" (measured at Time 1)  

**Mediator Variable:**  
- "depression symptoms" (measured at Time 2), identified as a potential intervening factor between internalized homonegativity and intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors.  

**Additional Relevant Variables:**  
- "social support" (measured at Time 2) moderates the association between internalized homonegativity and intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors.  
- "intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors" (measured at Time 2) is the outcome variable influenced by internalized homonegativity and depression symptoms.  
- "recent bacterial STI diagnosis" (measured at Time 3) is associated with intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors.  

**Study Design:**  
- "moderated mediation analysis" testing internalized homonegativity (T1) → depression symptoms (T2) → intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors (T2), with social support moderating paths.  
- "logistic regression" examining intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors (T2) → recent bacterial STI diagnosis (T3).  

**Results:**  
- Internalized homonegativity (T1) conditionally predicted intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors (T2) at low social support levels (β = .08, *p* < .001).  
- Depression symptoms (T2) directly predicted intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors (β = .02, *p* = .011).  
- Social support moderated the direct path between internalized homonegativity and intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors (*p* = .045).  
- Intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors (T2) predicted bacterial STI diagnosis (T3) (OR = 1.68, *p* < .001).  

**Conclusion:**  
- Social support buffered the effect of internalized homonegativity on intrusive sexual thoughts/behaviors, indirectly reducing STI occurrence.

【第69个问题：how to distinguish social undermining and social support】
问题相关文本：**Sentences related to distinguishing social undermining and social support:**

1.  "While social support is commonly addressed in weight management interventions, lesser attention has been given to social undermining."
2.  "Social undermining is distinct from an absence or lack of social support in that it includes actions (e.g., offering someone foods they are attempting to avoid) or discouraging comments (e.g., teasing for exercise habits) related to healthy dietary and exercise behavior or weight."
3.  "Within the context of weight management, social undermining can be defined as social interactions or events that promote lapse (i.e., nonadherence to healthy behavior) in dietary and/or physical activity behavior, whether intentional or not."
4.  "Multiple studies found a coexisting influence of social undermining and social support."
5.  "One mixed-methods study reported that participants received verbal support from their family, but were also undermined by their actions... This indicates that both undermining and support may come from the same individual."
6.  "Another study discovered this phenomenon through survey methods and found that family members in general provided the most frequent support and undermining of healthy eating and physical activity."
7.  "These results indicate that future weight loss interventions that include social support components should also include social undermining components, as there is evidence that the presence of social support does not mitigate the presence of social undermining."
8.  "Findings from this review also suggest that those who provide the most support for healthy behaviors are commonly the largest source of undermining and that these are typically close relationships such as family members."
9.  "Social undermining seems to negatively affect weight and weight-related behavior and often coexists with social support."
回答69答案：Social undermining includes actions like offering forbidden foods or discouraging comments that promote nonadherence to healthy behavior, distinct from an absence of support.

【第70个问题：what is the aim of this study】
问题相关文本：Objective: To examine the rates as well as the interdependence of depressive symptoms and sleep problems in patients with cancer and their intimate partner family caregivers.  
The primary aim of the present study was to explore the rates as well as the interdependence of depressive symptoms and sleep in those diagnosed with cancer and their family caregivers.  
We will address the limitations of prior research by including a large sample of patients with a wide range of cancer types and stages and their caregivers, and the three of the most important sleep parameters (i.e., sleep duration, efficiency, and quality).  
Understanding the interdependence of depressive symptoms and sleep between those diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers will build on accumulating evidence for the need of dyadic interventions designed to improve the sleep and depressive symptoms in both patients diagnosed with cancer and their intimate partner caregivers.  
The study provides evidence of actor and partner (interdependence) effects of patients’ depressive symptoms and family caregivers’ sleep problems.  
Los objetivos del estudio fueron examinar las tasas y la interdependencia de los síntomas depresivos y los problemas del sueño en pacientes con cáncer y sus cuidadores familiares.

【第74个问题：what is chronic health conditions】
问题相关文本：Based on the provided text segments, all sentences directly defining or describing chronic health conditions are:

1.  "Chronic health conditions (e.g., arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis) are highly common and associated with a significant burden to individuals and society (World Health Organisation, 2011)."
2.  "For some, the presence of a chronic health condition results in clinically significant distress and disruptions to their day-to-day functioning (Härter et al., 2007; Moss-Morris, 2013; Read et al., 2017; Scott, Correa, et al., 2023)."
3.  "In turn, these factors can adversely affect the course and outcome of chronic health conditions (Kroenke et al., 2007; Roy-Byrne et al., 2008)."
4.  "Eligible participants were: ... (c) reported a diagnosis of one or more chronic physical health conditions, and (d) reported that their health condition significantly impacted their emotional well-being and quality of life."
5.  "Due to the high diversity and comorbidity of chronic health conditions, individual health conditions could not be examined as unique predictors of treatment outcomes."
6.  "However, we categorized participants as to whether they reported a current chronic pain condition (yes, no), the number of chronic health conditions present (1, 2, 3, 4, or more), and whether participants reported polypharmacy (yes, no; defined as taking ${\geq}5\$ prescription medications [Masnoon et al., 2017])." (Specifically mentions "number of chronic health conditions present" and "multimorbidity" in context).
7.  "This is commonly observed among participants with chronic health conditions and reflects the multifaceted nature of psychological adjustment to illness, and consequent approach to outcomes selection."
回答74答案：Chronic health conditions (e.g., arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis) are highly common and associated with a significant burden to individuals and society.

【第77个问题：what are the measurements used in the study】
问题相关文本：Demographic (e.g., age, gender, employment, education), clinical (e.g., health condition, medication usage, multimorbidity), psychological (e.g., baseline symptom severity), and treatment-related variables were examined.  
Predictor variables included demographic variables, initial symptom severity, clinical characteristics, and treatment-related variables.  
Categorical demographic predictors were collected at assessment and included gender (male, female), relationship status (married/de facto, widow/divorced/separated), education (Year 12 or less, trade certificate/apprenticeship/diploma, university degree), and employment (employed full-time, employed part-time/casual, retired, registered disabled, unemployed/seeking work, not in the labor force). Age was treated as a continuous predictor.  
Initial symptom severity predictors were treated as continuous predictors and included participants’ pretreatment scores on the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WHODAS.  
Clinical characteristics collected at assessment included participants’ mental health service use (never, yes but not current, yes and currently using mental health services).  
We categorized participants as to whether they reported a current chronic pain condition (yes, no), the number of chronic health conditions present (1, 2, 3, 4, or more), and whether participants reported polypharmacy (yes, no; defined as taking ${\geq}5$ prescription medications [Masnoon et al., 2017]).  
Potential treatment-related predictors included participant engagement (yes, no; defined as completing four or more lessons), total time spent with therapist $(\operatorname{0-}\!24\operatorname*{min}$ , 25–39 min, $40{-}59\ \mathrm{min}$ , and ${\geq}60\,\mathrm{min}$ ; this variable was treated categorically due to its skewed distribution).  
Outcomes included clinically meaningful response $(\geq\!50\%$ improvement in symptoms) and deterioration $(\ge\!30\%$ increase in symptoms) in depression, anxiety, and self-reported disability.  
Depression was measured using the PHQ-9, which asks participants to rate on a 4-point scale $(0= \text{not at all to } 3= \text{nearly every day})$ how often they have been bothered by depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks.  
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. Participants rate on a 4-point scale $(0\,{=} \text{not at all to } 3= \text{nearly every day})$ how often they have been bothered by anxiety symptoms over the past 2 weeks.  
Disability was assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), which is a 12-item questionnaire asking participants to rate on a 5-point scale $(0\,{=}\,\text{none to } 4= \text{extreme or cannot do})$ the level of difficulty in completing identified tasks in the past 30 days (Üstün et al., 2010).  
Participants were coded as having demonstrated a response regarding depression and anxiety if they reported ${\geq}50\%$ symptom reduction between pre- and posttreatment. Participants were coded as demonstrating a clinical response on disability if they reported $\geq\!30\%$ reduction in functional difficulties.  
Deterioration was defined as a symptom increase by $\geq\!30\%$ between pre- and posttreatment, along with posttreatment scores falling within the clinical range.  
For the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, scores $\ge\!10$ are widely regarded as being in the clinical ranges. Due to the lack of established cutoffs on the WHODAS, scores corresponding to the approximately 75th percentile were chosen $(\ge\!10)$ , based on Australian normative data (Andrews et al., 2009).  
Response analyses were restricted to participants who reported scores above the recognized clinical cutoffs at pretreatment for each outcome domain.  
Deterioration analyses [were] restricted to participants who scored in the clinical range at posttreatment.  
Multivariable regression models were built to identify significant predictor variables of response and deterioration.  
Additional indicators of model fit were reported, including the area under the curve and Negelkerke’s $R^{2}$.  
The model discrimination ability (correctly classify outcomes) was assessed by area under the curve (AUC).  
Nagelkerke’s $R^{2}$ was reported, which indicates the proportion of variance in the likelihood of response or deterioration explained by the variables in each model.  
Analyses were conducted using Stata Version 16.1.  
The final models predicting participant outcomes explained $7\%{-}16\%$ of the variance in the likelihood of response or deterioration.

【第80个问题：what is PA】
问题相关文本：Physical activity (PA) plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  
Regular engagement in PA is widely recognized for its protective effect against many chronic diseases, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and Type 2 diabetes.  
Furthermore, PA helps not only in maintaining an ideal body weight and preventing obesity but also can improve psychological well-being and enrich life quality.  
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines physical inactivity as failing to meet the recommended levels of at least 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity PA per week or any equivalent combination.  
This study explored how different planning strategies help people adhere to their physical activity (PA) goals daily and over a week.  
Action planning was more influential in realizing individuals’ intentions to engage in PA on a daily basis, whereas coping planning had a greater impact on a weekly basis.  
These insights can inform the development of more effective strategies to help individuals increase their PA.  
The study aims to investigate the influence of time frame and perceived stress on the relationship between intention, planning, and physical activity (PA) within the health action process approach framework.  
Following a baseline assessment [...] which measured [...] intentions to do PA, action planning, and coping planning [...], a 21-day daily survey was conducted, recording participants’ moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels each day and their daily intention to do PA.  
The study found that action planning had a more immediate impact on daily MVPA while coping planning played a more significant role in mediating the relationship between intention and MVPA on a weekly basis.  
These findings suggest that planning strategies may be tailored to specific time frames, with action planning having a larger impact on daily intentions while coping planning better supports weekly intentions.  
This research contributes to our understanding of health behavior and offers insights for interventions to promote PA.  
El estudio tiene como objetivo investigar la influencia del período de tiempo y el estrés percibido en la relación entre la intención, la planificación y la actividad física (PA, por sus siglas en inglés) dentro del marco del Enfoque del Proceso de Acción de Salud.  
Tras una evaluación inicial [...] que midió [...] las intenciones de hacer PA, planificación de acciones y planificación de afrontamiento [...], se realizó una encuesta diaria de 21 días, registrando los niveles de actividad física de moderada a vigorosa (MVPA) de los participantes cada día y su intención diaria de hacer PA.  
El estudio encontró que la planificación de acciones tuvo un impacto más inmediato en la MVPA diaria, mientras que la planificación de afrontamiento jugó un papel más importante en la mediación de la relación entre la intención y la MVPA semanal.  
Estos hallazgos sugieren que las estrategias de planificación pueden adaptarse a períodos de tiempo específicos, teniendo la planificación de acción un mayor impacto en las intenciones diarias, mientras que la planificación de afrontamiento respalda mejor las intenciones semanales.  
Esta investigación contribuye a nuestra comprensión del comportamiento de salud y ofrece ideas para intervenciones para promover la PA.
回答80答案：physical activity

【第81个问题：what is HAPA】
问题相关文本：The HAPA model is a well-established model for understanding health behavior, including PA. The HAPA model distinguishes between preintentional motivation processes, which lead to the formation of behavioral intentions, and postintentional volition processes, which lead to the actual health behavior (Schwarzer, 2008). Within the postintentional phase, action planning and coping planning are proposed as key mediators between intention and behavior. In line with the postintentional phase of the HAPA framework, which proposes action planning and coping planning to be key mediators between intention and behavior, we hypothesize that... These findings support the notion that having both types of planning in place are critical to increasing levels of PA, consistent with previous literature emphasizing the importance of planning in promoting PA (Carraro & Gaudreau, 2013). While our findings suggest that the mediating effects of action planning primarily occur within individuals, Conroy et al. (2013) highlight the significant role of both within-person variations and between-person differences in understanding daily MVPA and intentions. This contrasting finding underscores the need to explore further how between-subject factors may also influence the mediation effects observed in different settings or under varying daily constraints. Counterbalancing these limitations are some strengths. A notable strength of this study is the comparison of the dynamics in the intention–planning–PA link across different time frames. This approach provides valuable insights into the temporal aspects of planning processes and their impact on behavior. By conducting this study using daily repeated measures and analyzing the data with multilevel modeling, these results provide greater insights about the intention–planning–behavior relationship than can be obtained from cross-sectional or one-time prospective studies. Additionally, the use of multilevel modeling in the daily analyses allowed us to account for both within-person and between-person variations, enhancing the richness of our findings. These strengths advance the theoretical understanding of planning mechanisms and can have practical implications for designing time-specific interventions to promote PA.

回答81答案：Health Action Process Approach
--------------------------------------------------
【第82个问题：what is the distinguish between action planning and coping planning】
问题相关文本：Action planning involves goal-oriented strategies specifying when, where, and how to implement a particular behavior. Coping planning focuses on strategies to handle obstacles that may interfere with the carrying out of an intention. Action planning was more influential in realizing individuals’ intentions to engage in PA on a daily basis, whereas coping planning had a greater impact on a weekly basis. Action planning involves immediate, practical steps that can be integrated into daily routines [...] Conversely, coping planning may be less critical on a daily basis. Coping planning, which involves preparing for potential barriers, may be particularly effective in helping individuals carry out their PA intentions over more extended periods. Action planning is more crucial for immediate behaviors such as MVPA on the following day. Coping planning became more critical in longer timeframes (1 week). Action planning had a more immediate impact on daily MVPA while coping planning played a more significant role in mediating the relationship between intention and MVPA on a weekly basis. Action planning involves goal-oriented strategies specifying when, where, and how to implement a particular behavior. Coping planning focuses on strategies to handle obstacles that may interfere with the carrying out of an intention. Coping planning better supports weekly intentions. Action planning having a larger impact on daily intentions while coping planning better supports weekly intentions. Action planning was a significant mediator between intention and daily MVPA, whereas coping planning was not. Coping planning played a greater mediating role than action planning in the relationship between intention and weekly MVPA levels. Coping planning remained associated with 1-week MVPA. Action planning is more crucial for immediate behaviors. Coping planning facilitates longterm resilience against obstacles. Action planning having a larger impact on daily intentions while coping planning better supports weekly intentions.

【第83个问题：what is MVPA】
问题相关文本：Based on the analysis, here are all sentences directly defining or explaining MVPA:

1.  "a 21-day daily survey was conducted, recording participants’ moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels each day"
2.  "Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the daily dynamics in the intention–planning–MVPA link"
3.  "mediation was used to analyze how predictors influenced MVPA levels over 1 week after the baseline assessment"
4.  "Participants’ daily MVPA levels during the 21-day follow-up period were assessed using two items from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF; Craig et al., 2003): (a) “How much time did you spend doing vigorous physical activity today?” and (b) “How much time did you spend doing moderate physical activity today?” The duration of PA (in minutes, truncated at $180\,\mathrm{min}$ ) was multiplied by four or eight metabolic equivalents (METs) for moderate or vigorous PA, respectively, to obtain the daily MVPA level in MET-minutes/day (IPAQ website administrator, 2022)."
5.  "For the 1-week analysis... The average daily MVPA scores for these participants were calculated by averaging their daily MVPA scores across the days they participated. The average daily MVPA score was then multiplied by 7 to obtain the 1-week MVPA score in MET-minutes/week."
6.  "action planning had a more immediate impact on daily MVPA while coping planning played a more significant role in mediating the relationship between intention and MVPA on a weekly basis."
7.  "we hypothesize that: Hypothesis 1 (H1): Both action planning and coping planning mediate the relationship between the intention to do PA and actual moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels across different time frames, with a specific focus on daily intervals and a 1-week period."

【第84个问题：what is the aim of this study】
问题相关文本：Objective: The study aims to investigate the influence of time frame and perceived stress on the relationship between intention, planning, and physical activity (PA) within the health action process approach framework.  
This study aims to explore the role of different time frames on the translation of the intention to do PA into actual PA behavior and how perceived stress influences the intention–planning–behavior link.  
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Both action planning and coping planning mediate the relationship between the intention to do PA and actual moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels across different time frames, with a specific focus on daily intervals and a 1-week period.  
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Perceived stress moderates the relationships within the intention–planning–PA link. Specifically, baseline perceived stress is expected to influence all pathways in this link, while it is also hypothesized to impact the daily dynamics between intentions to do PA, action and coping planning, and subsequent MVPA levels.  
The study found that action planning had a more immediate impact on daily MVPA while coping planning played a more significant role in mediating the relationship between intention and MVPA on a weekly basis.  
Perceived stress did not significantly moderate the intention–planning–behavior link in either time frame.  
These findings suggest that planning strategies may be tailored to specific time frames, with action planning having a larger impact on daily intentions while coping planning better supports weekly intentions.  
This study explored how different planning strategies help people adhere to their physical activity (PA) goals daily and over a week.  
We found that action planning was more influential in realizing individuals’ intentions to engage in PA on a daily basis, whereas coping planning had a greater impact on a weekly basis.  
This study investigated the time frame for the realization of intentions to do PA.  
It was found that action planning was more critical for realizing intentions in shorter timeframes (daily) while coping planning became more critical in longer timeframes (1 week).  
Contrary to expectations, perceived stress levels did not moderate the intention–planning–PA link.

【第86个问题：what is TPB】
问题相关文本：Behavioral intentions have been identified as key proximal determinants of action in a range of theories used to predict health behaviors (e.g., theory of planned behavior [TPB], Ajzen, 1991; reasoned action approach [RAA], Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010; protection motivation theory, Rogers, 1983; social cognitive theory, Bandura, 1997).  
Although the TPB (Ajzen, 1991) and RAA (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010) both identify intentions as the sole proximal determinant of action, various primary empirical studies and metaanalyses suggest that other variables can directly influence action independently of intentions. Four such variables were considered here, three taken from the TPB/RAA (i.e., attitudes, norms, perceived behavioral control) and one external variable (i.e., past behavior/habit).  
Although theoretical accounts of the TPB/RAA predict that perceived behavioral control (i.e., perceptions of the degree to which behavior is within one’s control) has effects on behavior mediated through intentions or moderated effects through changing the intention–behavior relationship, a considerable number of primary studies and meta-analyses support a direct effect of perceived behavioral control on action.  
The majority of TPB studies and meta-analyses of such studies (e.g., R. R. C. McEachan et al., 2011) confirm predictions from the theory that the effects of attitudes and norms on action are fully mediated by intentions.  
Study 1 and Study 2 used variables from the TPB (i.e., attitude; norms; perceived behavioral control; past behavior), while Study 3 and Study 4 used variables from the RAA (affective and cognitive attitude; injunctive and descriptive norms; capacity and autonomy; past behavior).  
In summary, across four studies looking at different types of health behavior, we examined the predictors of action among those with strong intentions to act. The set of predictors examined comprised attitude (overall, Studies 1 and 2; affective and cognitive, Studies 3 and 4), norms (overall, Studies 1 and 2; injunctive and descriptive, Studies 3 and 4), perceived behavioral control (overall, Studies 1 and 2; capacity and autonomy, Studies 3 and 4), and past behavior (frequency, Studies 1–4; habit, Study 4).  
In conclusion, the current research shows the value of exploring the power of TPB/RAA variables plus past behavior/habit as predictors of action in those with already strong (extreme) intentions.

【第87个问题：what is RAA】
问题相关文本：Based on your request to identify all content related to RAA (Reasoned Action Approach), here are the relevant sentences extracted verbatim from the provided text:

1.  Behavioral intentions have been identified as key proximal determinants of action in a range of theories used to predict health behaviors (e.g., theory of planned behavior [TPB], Ajzen, 1991; **reasoned action approach [RAA], Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010**; protection motivation theory, Rogers, 1983; social cognitive theory, Bandura, 1997).
2.  In meta-analyses of the **RAA** (e.g., R. McEachan et al., 2016) indicate that capacity but not autonomy, predicts action independently of intentions.
3.  In the **RAA** (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010) splits perceived behavioral control into capacity (i.e., one’s confidence to engage in the behavior) and autonomy (i.e., perceived control over whether or not to engage in the behavior).
4.  In the **RAA**, attitudes are split into affective attitudes (i.e., the belief that engaging in the behavior would be pleasant) and cognitive attitudes (i.e., the belief that engaging in the behavior would be beneficial), whereas norms are split into injunctive norms (i.e., the belief that others would approve of the individual engaging in the behavior) and descriptive norms (i.e., the belief that others engage in the behavior).
5.  Meta-analyses of the **RAA** support the idea that affective attitudes (but not cognitive attitudes) and descriptive norms (but not injunctive norms) directly influence action independently of intentions (R. McEachan et al., 2016).
6.  These findings from the **RAA** (R. McEachan et al., 2016) might suggest that affective attitudes and descriptive norms (but not cognitive attitudes or injunctive norms) directly predict action in those with strong intentions.
7.  Study 3 and Study 4 used variables from the **RAA** (affective and cognitive attitude; injunctive and descriptive norms; capacity and autonomy; past behavior).
8.  The set of predictors examined comprised attitude (overall, Studies 1 and 2; affective and cognitive, Studies 3 and 4), norms (overall, Studies 1 and 2; injunctive and descriptive, Studies 3 and 4), perceived behavioral control (overall, Studies 1 and 2; capacity and autonomy, Studies 3 and 4), and past behavior (frequency, Studies 1–4; habit, Study 4).
9.  Measures of cognitive versus affective attitudes, injunctive versus descriptive norms, and capacity versus autonomy from the **RAA** were used as predictors of action alongside past behavior and habit.
10. While the majority of TPB studies and meta-analyses of such studies (e.g., R. R. C. McEachan et al., 2011) confirm predictions from the theory that the effects of attitudes and norms on action are fully mediated by intentions... Meta-analyses of the **RAA** support the idea that affective attitudes (but not cognitive attitudes) and descriptive norms (but not injunctive norms) directly influence action independently of intentions (R. McEachan et al., 2016).
11. This is important because although intentions are construed as the most important predictor of behavior in several health behavior theories (e.g., Ajzen, 1991; Bandura, 1997; **Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010**; Rogers, 1983)...
12. In conclusion, the current research shows the value of exploring the power of TPB/**RAA** variables plus past behavior/habit as predictors of action in those with already strong (extreme) intentions.
13. Study 4 also used a multibehavior design that allows tests of average effects within individuals across behaviors.
14. Measures of cognitive versus affective attitudes, injunctive versus descriptive norms, and capacity versus autonomy from the **RAA** were used as predictors of action alongside past behavior and habit.
15. Study 3 extended Studies 1 and 2 by examining **RAA** variables in relation to smoking initiation in adolescents.

回答93答案：a maladaptive regulation strategy
--------------------------------------------------
【第94个问题：what is SST】
问题相关文本：Aging theories such as socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) suggest adults increase their desires for building emotional meaning as they age, leading to changes in coping, emotional responding, and processing of both positive and negative events (Carstensen, 1995; Carstensen et al., 2003).  
The SST suggests that emotion regulation skills, both adaptive and maladaptive, may be more impactful on health and well-being as individuals age (Carstensen et al., 2003).  
These findings are consistent with the SST, which suggests that as people age, emotion regulation becomes more impactful on health and overall well-being as individuals experience changes in coping, emotional responding, and processing of both positive and negative events (Carstensen, 1995; Carstensen et al., 2003).  
Consistent with the SST, prior research and theory posit that effective emotion regulation skills use can mitigate the deleterious health impact of aging (Urry & Gross, 2010).

【第95个问题：define inflammaging】
问题相关文本：Accelerated biological aging—or inflammaging—is the result of chronic activation of the immune system, which subsequently heightens chronic inflammation on the body, thus heightening the likelihood of inflammation-based diseases throughout middle age and older adulthood (Franceschi et al., 2018). However, it is important to note that the literature focused on inflammation and aging has been done in industrialized nations in majority group members (e.g., White, non-Hispanic) and inflammaging research in other cultures have not established the same trends (McDade, 2023).
回答95答案：Accelerated biological aging resulting from chronic activation of the immune system.
--------------------------------------------------
【第96个问题：what is Intervention Dosage】
问题相关文本：Intervention dosage was indexed by the duration of the intervention, the number of sessions, and total contact time in treatment arms of trials to promote physical activity.  
Dose is defined as the “exact amount of a medicine or extent of some other treatment to be given or taken at one time or at stated intervals”.  
Intervention dosage has three parameters: Duration is the time period over which the intervention is delivered (e.g., 2 weeks and 1 year), the number of sessions is the intervention frequency or how much contact is made with participants (e.g., 12 sessions), and total contact time is the amount of intervention or how long participants are expected to interact with program materials (e.g., 15 min, 8 hr).  
The relationship between the indices of dosage and intervention effect sizes was assessed in 23.6% of meta-analyses, and associations did not differ from zero in 70%–85% of tests (Study 1).  
In Study 2, we retrieved 838 tests for duration, 370 tests for the number of sessions, and 167 tests for contact time. Duration had a very small negative association with effect sizes b = −.002, 95% confidence interval [−.003,−.001]; number of sessions and contact time were not related to intervention effectiveness.  
An exploratory study (N = 50) indicated that health psychology researchers overestimated the association between dosage and effect sizes (r estimates > .25).  
Although physical activity interventions with a higher dosage are expected to be more effective, the findings showed no relationship between dosage and intervention impact. Intervention dosage may moderate the influence of intervention content rather than directly determine physical activity change.  
Dosage parameters were not associated with interventions’ effectiveness. Increased dosage does not, on its own, lead to improved rates of physical activity.  
“The bigger the better” is a common idiom, but intervention dosage is rarely examined empirically.  
There are theoretical grounds and preliminary evidence for the prediction that intervention dosage is positively associated with behavior change.  
We aimed to estimate the strength of the association between three parameters of intervention dosage (duration, number of sessions, and total contact time) and how much change in physical activity is observed in respective interventions.  
The impact of intervention dosage on physical activity change is tested infrequently in meta-analyses of physical activity interventions.  
Meta-analytic evidence thus suggests that intervention dosage is not associated with effectiveness.  
Study 2 was conducted to capitalize on the data regarding intervention dosage that was reported but underutilized in the metaanalyses reviewed in Study 1.  
Even with this relatively large database (838 tests for duration, 370 tests for number of sessions, and 167 tests for contact time), the correlation between dosage and intervention impact was effectively zero.  
Multiple checks on the integrity of the metaregression analyses did not alter this conclusion.  
The Operating Conditions Framework (OCF; Rothman & Sheeran, 2021) may offer insight into why intervention dosage was unrelated to changes in physical activity. According to the OCF, strategies are effective in promoting health behavior change to the extent that (a) the strategy engages a target and (b) the target is valid.  
An OCF analysis suggests at least three possible explanations for why increasing an intervention’s dosage seems to have no influence on behavior.  
The benefits afforded by increasing intervention dosage may be tied to specific BCTs.  
Research is needed both to conceptualize and test potential interactions between dosage parameters and BCTs.  
The present research was confined to an examination of intended dose (i.e., the duration, frequency, and amount of intervention that researchers endeavored to give participants) and not the actual dose.  
Editors and reviewers should request information about all three dosage parameters in reports of behavioral interventions.  
Evidence did not support the hypothesis that greater duration, number of sessions, and contact time enhances behavior change in physical activity interventions.  
Intervention dosage may moderate the influence of BCTs rather than directly promote outcomes.
回答96答案：the “exact amount of a medicine or extent of some other treatment to be given or taken at one time or at stated intervals”.

【第97个问题：what is meta-analysis】
问题相关文本：Based on the provided text segments, here are all sentences directly related to the core question "what is meta-analysis" and the analysis of meta-analyses conducted in this research, presented in the order they appear:

1.  In Study 1, we synthesized 161 meta-analyses of physical activity interventions to examine the relationship between intervention dosage and intervention impact on physical activity.
2.  The synthesis extended a review benchmarking the impact of physical activity interventions (Wright et al., 2021) that was registered on Prospero (CRD42020136187).
3.  Studies were obtained via a computerized search of relevant databases (PubMed, Web of Science [all databases], CINAHL, and Cochrane Library).
4.  There were four inclusion criteria for the review. First, the report was a meta-analysis or systematic review that reported summary effect sizes (e.g., $d$ and odds ratio) for interventions to promote physical activity.
5.  We excluded reviews that focused solely on sedentary behavior but included reviews that combined physical activity and sedentary behavior data.
6.  Third, the report summarized a minimum of five primary studies.
7.  Figure 1 shows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram.
8.  In total, 161 eligible meta-analyses were identified.
9.  References for the 161 meta-analyses are presented in the online supplemental materials.
10. For each meta-analysis, we coded whether an association between a dosage parameter and effect sizes was tested, whether the association was significant, and if so, whether the relationship was positive or negative.
11. Most meta-analyses $\mathit{k}=123$ , $76.9\%$ ) did not test an association between intervention dosage (duration, number of sessions, or contact time) and the impact of the trial on physical activity.
12. Of the 38 reviews that did test for an association, five tested associations for all three dosage variables, and seven tested associations for two dosage variables (see Figure 2A).
13. Thirty-three reviews $(20.6\%)$ tested the relation between intervention duration and effect sizes.
14. Sixty-two meta-analyses reported data on both intervention duration and effect size for primary studies but did not formally test the relationship.
15. Ten reviews $(6.3\%)$ tested whether the number of sessions predicted intervention effect sizes.
16. Whereas only 10 reviews tested the sessions–impact relation, 25 reviews reported the data necessary to do so.
17. Ten reviews $(6.3\%)$ tested whether contact time predicted intervention effect sizes.
18. Seven additional reviews had data that could have been used to test the influence of contact time on physical activity.
19. The impact of intervention dosage on physical activity change is tested infrequently in meta-analyses of physical activity interventions.
20. Meta-analytic evidence thus suggests that intervention dosage is not associated with effectiveness, though this conclusion is tempered by the relatively small number of tests undertaken in reviews to date.
21. Study 2: Reanalysis of Primary Data From 852 Physical Activity Interventions Reported in 161 Meta-Analyses
22. A striking feature of meta-analyses of physical activity interventions is that information about intervention dosage and effect size data were routinely presented for primary studies but were not analyzed.
23. Study 2 was conducted to capitalize on the data regarding intervention dosage that was reported but underutilized in the meta-analyses reviewed in Study 1.
24. For each of the 161 meta-analyses, we retrieved dosage and effect size data for primary studies.
25. The pattern of findings was consistent with what was observed in Study 1, which was based on the limited set of meta-analyses that examined this issue.
26. First, a synthesis of 161 meta-analyses showed that there was no association between effect sizes and intervention duration, number of sessions, or contact time in $70\%{-}85\%$ of tests.
27. Second, because these meta-analyses failed to utilize fully the data available on intervention dosage, we reanalyzed the dosage and effect size data from the primary studies included in these reviews.
28. First, more extensive data would have been desirable. Out of 161 meta-analyses included in Study 1, only 33 tested the impact of duration and only 10 reviews tested associations for number of sessions and total contact time.
29. En el Estudio 1, sintetizamos 161 metaanálisis de intervenciones de actividad física para examinar la relación entre la dosis de la intervención y el impacto de la intervención en la actividad física.
30. La relación entre los índices de dosis y los tamaños del efecto de la intervención se evaluó en el $23.6\%$ de los metaanálisis, y las asociaciones no difirieron de cero en el $70\%$ al $85\%$ de las pruebas (Estudio 1).
回答97答案：synthesized 161 meta-analyses of physical activity interventions to examine the relationship between intervention dosage and intervention impact on physical activity; meta-analysis or systematic review that reported summary effect sizes (e.g., $d$ and odds ratio) for interventions; reanalyzed the dosage and effect size data from the primary studies included in these reviews

问题相关文本：Results: The relationship between the indices of dosage and intervention effect sizes was assessed in $23.6\%$ of meta-analyses, and associations did not differ from zero in $70\%{-}85\%$ of tests (Study 1).  
Most meta-analyses $\mathit{k}=123$ , $76.9\%$ ) did not test an association between intervention dosage (duration, number of sessions, or contact time) and the impact of the trial on physical activity.  
Thirty-three reviews $(20.6\%)$ tested the relation between intervention duration and effect sizes. Of these, 28 $(84.8\%)$ observed no significant association between duration and intervention impact.  
Ten reviews $(6.3\%)$ tested whether the number of sessions predicted intervention effect sizes. Eight $(80\%)$ found no significant relationship between session number and intervention impact.  
Ten reviews $(6.3\%)$ tested whether contact time predicted intervention effect sizes. Seven $(70\%)$ found no significant relationship between contact time and intervention impact.  
The impact of intervention dosage on physical activity change is tested infrequently in meta-analyses of physical activity interventions.  
When the relationship between dosage and trial impact was tested, associations generally were not significant $?0\%{-}85\%$ of tests).  
Meta-analytic evidence thus suggests that intervention dosage is not associated with effectiveness.
回答99答案：associations did not differ from zero in $70\%{-}85\%$ of tests

【第100个问题：what is the main result of the study】
问题相关文本：Results: The relationship between the indices of dosage and intervention effect sizes was assessed in $23.6\%$ of meta-analyses, and associations did not differ from zero in $70\%{-}85\%$ of tests (Study 1). In Study 2, we retrieved 838 tests for duration, 370 tests for the number of sessions, and 167 tests for contact time. Duration had a very small negative association with effect sizes $b\,{=}\,{-}.002$ , $95\%$ confidence interval $[-.003,-.001]$ ; number of sessions and contact time were not related to intervention effectiveness.  

Conclusions: Although physical activity interventions with a higher dosage are expected to be more effective, the findings showed no relationship between dosage and intervention impact.  

Public Significance Statement: The findings from 161 meta-analyses of physical activity interventions (Study 1) and 852 randomized trials (Study 2) indicated that dosage parameters were not associated with interventions’ effectiveness. Increased dosage does not, on its own, lead to improved rates of physical activity.  

General Discussion: Two lines of evidence showed no relationship between intervention dosage and interventions’ effectiveness in promoting physical activity. First, a synthesis of 161 meta-analyses showed that there was no association between effect sizes and intervention duration, number of sessions, or contact time in $70\%{-}85\%$ of tests. Second... the correlation between dosage and intervention impact was effectively zero.  

Resumen: La duración tuvo una asociación negativa muy pequeña con el tamaño del efecto $b=-.002$ , IC del $95\%$ $[-.003,\,-.001])$ ; el número de sesiones y el tiempo de contacto no se relacionaron con la efectividad de la intervención... los hallazgos no mostraron relación entre la dosis y el impacto de la intervención.

【第102个问题：what is SA】
问题相关文本：Based on the provided text, here are all sentences directly referencing SA (Sexaholics Anonymous) or its principles:

1.  "In the study, 80 Polish individuals diagnosed with OCSB who attended Sexaholics Anonymous (SA) meetings participated."
2.  "The beneficial role of prayer as a spiritual practice in recovery among members of SA diagnosed with OCSB was therefore confirmed."
3.  "These findings should be an incentive for practitioners, therapists, medics, social workers, and psychologists to recommend prayer, as well as gratitude and hope, in interventions aimed at Polish patients suffering from OCSB."
4.  "In Poland, these groups are based on the heritage of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)... Accordingly, it should be treated by restoring the individual’s relationship with God or another higher power... (AA, 2001; Sexaholics Anonymous SA, 1989)."
5.  "The majority of Sexaholics Anonymous (SA) participants in Poland can be classified as both religious and spiritual, or at least spiritual."
6.  "This study aims to verify mechanisms underpinning the relationships between prayer and sexual abstinence and prayer and emotional well-being in SA participants diagnosed with OCSB and the role of gratitude to God/higher power and hope in these connections."
7.  "In SA participants, prayer can serve as a coping method..."
8.  "Wnuk and Charzyńska (2024) confirmed the forgiving image of God/higher power as a positive predictor of interpersonal forgiveness and the presence of meaning in life in members of Sexaholics Anonymous from Poland."
9.  "The concept of God/higher power plays a significant role in the recovery of substance and behavior-dependent Poles participating in mutual self-help groups... According to the 12-step program, restoration of one’s relationship with God/ higher power... take place in the third step... For self-help group members, there is an incentive to recognize God/higher power as a benefactor and build a relationship with this entity by implementing the 11th step, which entails the understanding that God/higher power takes care of the future and following Him will support one in achieving sobriety and satisfying life (Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, 1953)."
10. "Participants. The research sample consisted of 80 participants from SA meetings in Poland..."
11. "Sexual abstinence. Duration of sexual abstinence was measured with a single question: “How long have you maintained abstinence from sex (understood in accordance with SA principles) (in months)?”"
12. "This choice of dependent variables was caused by the fact that, according to expectations, sexual abstinence can be unrelated or at most weakly linked to emotional well-being. According to the SA literature, sexual abstinence by itself is a necessary, but not a sufficient, factor for sobriety, which is understood as leading a fulfilling and satisfying life (SA, 1989), connected with emotional well-being (Helm, 2019)."
13. "This study’s results have limited generalizability to individuals from Poland diagnosed with OCSB participating in mutual-aid groups..."
14. "The beneficial function of prayer to emotional well-being and maintaining the sexual abstinence of OCSB individuals attending mutual self-help groups was confirmed."
15. "First of all, prayer, being a way to build a secure bond with God/ higher power, should be implemented as a part of therapeutic programs and methods in the recovery process of Polish patients diagnosed with OCSB. Prayer and meditation are important elements of the 12-step Program. In SA participants, involvement in this form of support indirectly predicted life satisfaction and negative affect (Wnuk et al., 2024)."
16. "Furthermore, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, and social workers, within their supportive actions, should inform and recommend prayer practice as a potential method of improving well-being and maintaining sexual abstinence."
17. "Additionally, a comparison between participation in mutual-aid groups and other forms of treatment of OCSB patients... could show... whether prayer is also frequently used by religiously inclined individuals who are not motivated to engage in this spiritual practice by the 12-step program."

【第104个问题：what is Causal Graph used for psychological research】
问题相关文本：Causal graphs have provided psychology with a systematic framework that enables researchers to construct and simulate intricate systems for a holistic view of “bio-psychosocial” interactions. Yet, the labor-intensive nature of the methodology poses challenges, which requires multidisciplinary expertise in algorithmic development, exacerbating the complexities. Our study introduces a groundbreaking approach for computational hypothesis generation in psychology by leveraging the synergy between causal knowledge graphs and a large language model (LLM). This analysis produced a specialized causal graph for psychology. The causal graph serves as a reservoir of causal knowledge. Applying link prediction algorithms to the causal graph, we generated 130 potential psychological hypotheses. Such highly probable causal pairs act as springboards, catalyzing the genesis of new experimental designs or research hypotheses ripe for empirical probing. The causal graph, of paramount importance in psychology due to its cross-disciplinary potential, often demands vast amounts of expert involvement. Our innovative approach addresses this by utilizing LLM’s exceptional causal extraction abilities. The prominence of causal graphs in psychology is profound; they offer researchers a unified platform for synthesizing and hypothesizing diverse psychological realms. The union of the causal graphs’ systematic approach with AI-driven creativity paves the way for the future of psychological inquiry. The causal graph aids in unearthing the underlying logic and rationale of the outputs generated by LLMs. Leveraging causal graphs may herald a new era in model interpretability. Our methodology combined LLM with causal graphs, propelling psychological research forward by improving hypothesis generation and offering tools to blend theoretical and data-centric approaches.

【第105个问题：what is Link Prediction】
问题相关文本："Applying link prediction algorithms, we generated 130 potential psychological hypotheses"
"In the third step, an in-depth examination of these data was executed, adopting link prediction algorithms to forecast the dynamics within the causal relationship network for searching the highly potential causality concept pairs."
"Step 3: Hypothesis generation using link prediction."
"It hinges on the premise of proposing potential causal ties between concepts that our knowledge graph does not explicitly connect."
"The process intricately weaves together vector embedding, similarity analysis, and probability-based ranking." 
"Initially, concepts are transposed into a vector space using node2vec, which is valued for its ability to capture topological nuances. Here, every pair of unconnected concepts is assigned a similarity score, and pairs that do not meet a set benchmark are quickly discarded."
"As we dive deeper into the higher echelons of these scored pairs, the likelihood of their linkage is assessed using the Jaccard similarity of their neighboring concepts." 
"Subsequently, these potential causal relationships are organized in descending order of their derived probabilities, and the elite pairs are selected."
"Such highly probable causal pairs are not mere intellectual curiosity. They act as springboards, catalyzing the genesis of new experimental designs or research hypotheses ripe for empirical probing."
"Using pairs of highly probable causal concepts, we pushed GPT-4 to conjure novel causal hypotheses that bridge concepts."
"From this refined pool, 30 research ideas were chosen..."
"These hypotheses were derived by LLMCG’s evaluation of the most likely causal relationships related to well-being that had not been previously documented in research literature datasets."

【第106个问题：What hypothesis generation methods were compared in the study?】
问题相关文本：The study compared the following hypothesis generation methods:  
- The proposed LLM-based causal graph (LLMCG) algorithm  
- Hypotheses generated by doctoral students (Control-Human)  
- Hypotheses generated solely by the Claude-2 LLM (Control-Claude)  
- An ablation study comparing LLMCG with GPT-4 alone  

Specifically:  
1. LLMCG algorithm output (Random-selected LLMCG): 30 hypotheses randomly selected from 130 generated by the algorithm.  
2. LLMCG expert-vetted hypotheses (Expert-selected LLMCG): 30 hypotheses handpicked by psychological researchers from the algorithm’s output.  
3. PhD students’ output (Control-Human): 30 hypotheses randomly selected from 41 ideas generated by 13 doctoral students.  
4. Claude model output (Control-Claude): 30 hypotheses generated by Claude-2 and refined by GPT-4.  

Key comparisons:  
- LLMCG (both random-selected and expert-vetted) was compared against Control-Human and Control-Claude in novelty and usefulness.  
- LLMCG hypotheses matched the novelty level of Control-Human (no significant difference: $t(59)=4.32$, $p<0.001$ for Control-Human vs. Control-Claude; $t(59)=3.34$, $p=0.007$ for Random-selected LLMCG vs. Control-Claude) and significantly surpassed Control-Claude in novelty.  
- An ablation study showed LLMCG significantly outperformed GPT-4 alone in novelty ($t(119)=6.60$, $p<0.0001$) but not usefulness.  
- Deep semantic analysis revealed Control-Human had greater semantic distance than other groups, while LLMCG groups showed broader topic dispersion.

2.  **"Additionally, through deep semantic analysis, we demonstrated that our algorithm contains more profound conceptual incorporations and a broader semantic spectrum."**
3.  **"'The results showed that out of 289 relationships identified by GPT-4, $87.54\%$ were validated.'"**
4.  **"'Notably, when GPT-4 classified relationships as causal, only $13.02\%$ (31/238) were recognized as non-relationship, while $65.55\%$ (156/238) agreed upon as causality. This shows that GPT4 can accurately extract relationships (causality or correlation) in psychological texts, underscoring the potential as a tool for the construction of causal graphs.'"**
5.  **"Recognizing the indispensable role of human judgment, we periodically subjected random samples of extracted causal relationships to the scrutiny of domain experts. Their valuable feedback was instrumental in the real-time fine-tuning the extraction process."**
6.  **"The ANOVA results revealed a pronounced effect of the grouping factor... Further pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni method... significant disparities were discerned between Random-selected LLMCG and Control-Claude... and between Control-Human and Control-Claude... The Cohen’s $d$ values... indicate that the novelty scores for the Random-selected LLMCG and Control-Human groups are significantly higher than those for the Control-Claude group... comparisons involving Control-Human with both Random-selected LLMCG and Expert-selected LLMCG did not manifest statistically significant variances, indicating aligned novelty perceptions among these groups."**
7.  **"In terms of topic analysis, distinct variations were observed between Control-Human and LLMCG... For human evaluation, hypotheses from Ph.D. students paralleled the LLMCG in novelty... Furthermore, when juxtaposed with AI models such as Control-Claude, the LLMCG exhibited increased novelty."**
8.  **"Our findings underscore the ability of LLM, when integrated with causal graph techniques, to produce meaningful hypotheses with increased efficiency and quality... A multifaceted assessment approach... demonstrates that AI-augmented methods not only outshine LLM-only techniques in generating hypotheses with superior novelty and show quality on par with human expertise but also boast the capability for more profound conceptual incorporations and a broader semantic spectrum."**
9.  **"Deep semantic analysis bolstered these findings, emphasizing that our hypotheses have distinct cross-disciplinary merits, particularly when compared to those of individual doctoral scholars."**
10. **"Our innovative approach addresses this by utilizing LLM’s exceptional causal extraction abilities, effectively facilitating the transition of intense expert engagement from hypothesis creation to evaluation."**
11. **"Firstly, we acknowledge that constructing causal relationship graphs has potential inaccuracies, with ${\sim}13\%$ relationship pairs not aligning with human expert estimations."**
12. **"A striking observation during our validation was the inconsistency in the evaluations of the senior expert panels... This shift underscores a pivotal insight: our integration of AI has transitioned the dependency on scarce expert resources from hypothesis generation to evaluation."**

【第108个问题：what is CI】
问题相关文本：Based on the core question "what is CI", here is all relevant content extracted verbatim from the provided text:

1.  "To explore this further, we administered both objective and self-assessment tests of cognitive (CI) and emotional intelligence (EI) to GPT-3."
2.  "Results showed that GPT-3 outperformed average humans on CI tests requiring the use and demonstration of acquired knowledge."
3.  "GPT-3’s self-assessments of CI and EI didn’t always align with its objective performance..."
4.  "cognitive intelligence (CI) can be divided into a series of broad intelligences... with fluid reasoning (Gf) and comprehension or acculturation knowledge otherwise known as crystallized reasoning (Gc) traditionally regarded as its primary... and most extensively studied components."
5.  "While fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to domain-general reasoning ability... crystalized intelligence (Gc) is evidenced by broadness and depth of acquired knowledge related to language, concepts, and information."
6.  "Traditionally, intelligence is assessed using performance measures..."
7.  "selfestimates of CI and EI in humans show only weak to moderate correlations... with objectively measured intelligence"
8.  "tests measuring CI and EI"
9.  "CI was assessed with a battery of tests derived from the Gf/Gc Quickie Test Battery... to cover the two broad intelligence factors, namely fluid and crystalized reasoning."
10. "General Knowledge (20 items) measuring crystalized reasoning (Gc)... Vocabulary (18 items) is a test of Gc... Esoteric Analogies (24 items) is a factorially complex test that loads on both crystalized (Gc) and fluid (Gf) reasoning... Letter Series (15 items) measures Gf... Letter Counting Test (12 items) is used to assess working memory which is one of the key components of Gf."
11. "To obtain self-estimates of CI we applied six questions referring to capacities encompassed by fluid (Gf) and crystalized (Gc) intelligence: ability to reason, general knowledge, ability to learn new things, vocabulary and use of language, ability to understand difficult concepts, and knowledge of cultural issues."
12. "GPT-3’s self-estimates of CI overall imply that the chatbot tends to rate capacities encompassed by Gf... as high average, while at the same time ranking abilities subsumed under Gc... as just average."
13. "Comparison of self-estimates with its actual performance on tests of CI clearly shows that GPT-3 tends to underestimate its own performance on tests of crystalized intelligence (Gc)... while at the same time slightly overestimating its performance on tests of fluid intelligence (Gf)."
14. "The finding in response to RQ2 is that GPT-3’s selfassessments of cognitive and emotional intelligence are not aligned with its actual performance."

【第109个问题：what is EI】
问题相关文本：Based on the core question "what is EI", the following sentences contain content directly defining or describing Emotional Intelligence (EI):

1.  "Based on the most prominent theoretical model EI encompasses abilities to accurately perceive, use, understand, and manage emotional content (Mayer-Salovey, 1997)."
2.  "More recently, EI was also shown to fit within the CHC framework as one of the broad intelligences (Evans et al. 2020)."
3.  "Self-estimates of EI were gathered using six questions which were purposefully designed for this study to cover the following capacities encompassed by the EI construct: ability to recognize different emotions, use emotions to promote thinking, label emotions in communication, understand emotions and their causes and effects, regulate own emotions, and manage other people’s emotions."
4.  "The STEU and STEM assess emotional understanding and emotional management, two strategic dimensions of EI, according to the widely recognized Mayer-Salovey model (Mayer-Salovey, 1997)."
5.  "As empirical studies confirm, emotional understanding and management load on a broader dimension of EI, separate from other broad intelligence factors, such as fluid and crystalized abilities (Evans et al. 2020)."
6.  "The Situational Test of Emotional Understanding (STEU) and the Situational Test of Emotion Management (STEM) require not only cognitive understanding but also an intricate use of emotional information. The tests assess the ability to understand and manage emotions accurately in diverse situations, which characterizes a key aspect of emotional intelligence."
7.  "... in the EI domain, GPT-3 also performs comparably good as humans."
8.  "Finally, the largest discrepancy between GPT-3’s selfestimated and actual performance was observed with respect to EI, where the chatbot consistently overestimated its abilities, thus demonstrating the “above-average effect”. Part of the explanation might lie in the fact that in the problem-domain of EI, opposite to the problem-domain of CI, multiple adequate answers to the same problem often appear, which is why an objective estimate of one’s own performance becomes much more challenging, even for AI."

【第110个问题：do human tend to overestimate or underestimate their intelligence?】
问题相关文本：Based on the provided text, the following sentences directly relate to whether humans tend to overestimate or underestimate their intelligence:

1.  **"Traditionally, intelligence is assessed using performance measures, which were found to be the most accurate indicators of ability constructs (Schneider and McGrew, 2018). In contrast, self-estimates of intelligence are shown to be rather inaccurate, primarily because these account for a mixture of non-intellectual features that make people’s judgments of their actual abilities invalid (Mayer et al. 2016)."**
2.  **"To be exact, research shows that selfestimates of CI and EI in humans show only weak to moderate correlations $(\approx\!0.30)$ with objectively measured intelligence (Bracket et al. 2006; Furnham, 2001; Furnham and Grover, 2020; Paulhus, 1998; Reilly et al. 2022)."**
3.  **"Empirical findings suggest that human examinees tend to overestimate their intelligence, with self-estimates being typically about one standard deviation (i.e., 15 IQ units) above the population average IQ score of 100 (von Stumm et al. 2009). This is usually attributed to certain cognitive biases, one of them being the “above-average effect”, which is a tendency to see oneself as better than the average person with respect to socially desirable traits. The other is the self-esteem bias or a proclivity to evaluate one’s own characteristics in a way that is consistent with general self-esteem (Reilly et al. 2022)."**
4.  **"Interestingly, it was found that distortion of self-estimated intelligence varies as a function of actual intelligence, with high performers usually underestimating their intelligence and low performers overestimating their testscores."**
5.  **"Self-estimates of intelligence are affected by other factors as well, with gender effects being the best empirically verified. Males are repeatedly and across multiple cultures found to report higher self-estimates of intelligence then females, which is a phenomenon termed “male hubris-female humility” (von Stumm et al. 2009)."**
6.  **"This tendency in men was found to be more pronounced when it comes to intellectual abilities that are stereotypically seen as masculine, such as mathematical/logical and spatial abilities (Furnham, 2001)."**
7.  **"Comparison of self-estimates with its actual performance on tests of CI clearly shows that GPT-3 tends to underestimate its own performance on tests of crystalized intelligence (Gc) at least mildly, while at the same time slightly overestimating its performance on tests of fluid intelligence (Gf). The former is aligned with a trend established in human top performers to underestimate their own achievements, while the latter concurs with a tendency to overestimate one own’s non-verbal capacities typically displayed by men (e.g., Reilly et al. 2022; von Stumm et al. 2009)."**

Tests of Emotional Intelligence. EI was assessed using two performance-based measures of understanding and managing emotions, namely the Situational Test of Emotional Understanding (STEU) and the Situational Test of Emotion Management (STEM)...  
STEU is a measure of emotional understanding... 42 items of this test assess respondent’s knowledge of which emotion is most likely to be experienced in a given situation or which situation is most likely to cause a given emotion... For each situation respondents are asked to choose one of the five listed emotions.

Self-estimates of Emotional Intelligence. Self-estimates of EI were gathered using six questions which were purposefully designed for this study to cover the following capacities encompassed by the EI construct: ability to recognize different emotions, use emotions to promote thinking, label emotions in communication, understand emotions and their causes and effects, regulate own emotions, and manage other people’s emotions.  
For both CI and EI, self-estimates were made by choosing one of the categories... a) extremely low, b) borderline, c) low average, d) average, e) high average, f) superior, g) very superior.  
Table 1 presents the proportions of correct answers provided by GPT-3 on... EI tests... GPT-3’s performance on tests evaluating... emotional intelligence (EI) is considerably lower and aligns more closely with average human scores.

in the EI domain, GPT-3 also performs comparably good as humans.  
Finally, the largest discrepancy between GPT-3’s selfestimated and actual performance was observed with respect to EI, where the chatbot consistently overestimated its abilities, thus demonstrating the “above-average effect”.

【第112个问题：What is the application of attribution theory in the study?】
问题相关文本：Attribution refers to perceptions or inferences about the causes of actions, events, and outcomes. In the context of human-AI interaction, internal attribution refers to attributing the failure of AI chatbots to their capabilities, such as algorithms and NLP decision trees, while external attribution refers to blaming environmental factors or human errors.  
Attribution is believed to be related to sustained attitudes and behaviors and has been applied in the research of human-AI interactions. Studies on trust models in human-AI interaction suggest that when users attribute service failures to the capabilities of AI systems, it leads to a decrease in sustained trust because the capabilities of AI are seen as relatively constant and not easily changed in the short term. Conversely, attributing failures to external factors does not reduce users’ sustained trust in AI chatbots, as external factors are seen as more random and less likely to recur.  
This study introduces internal attribution (related to capability) and external attribution (related to the environment) as mediators to explain the mechanism of sustained trust. Internal attribution for AI customer service chatbot service failures is significantly negatively correlated with sustained trust, while external attribution is significantly positively correlated with sustained trust.  
The perception of anthropomorphic characteristics of AI chatbots reduces users’ tendency for internal attribution and promotes external attribution, thereby influencing sustained trust. Internal attribution and external attribution act as mediators in this process. The perception of the chatbot’s empathic abilities promotes external attribution but does not significantly reduce internal attribution tendencies. Similarly, the perceived quality of interaction with AI chatbots promotes external attribution but does not significantly reduce internal attribution tendencies.  
AI anxiety significantly moderates the impact of internal attribution on continued trust. When individual AI anxiety levels are high, the impact of internal attribution on sustained trust is strong, whereas it is weak when AI anxiety levels are low.  
According to Heider’s attribution theory, people tend to explain behaviors based on the known characteristics of the actor, whether human or machine. AI chatbots that display strong "human-like" qualities can enhance users’ perceptions of their capabilities. To maintain consistency in perceptions of AI chatbots’ capabilities, failures might be attributed to external circumstances or unforeseeable errors.  
This sustained trust is mediated by different attribution styles for failure. Specifically, users’ perception of the anthropomorphic features of AI chatbots reduces the likelihood of attributing service failures to the AI’s inherent abilities and encourages them to consider external environmental factors that might have caused the failure. Similarly, perceptions of the AI’s empathy and interaction quality promote external attributions for service failures.  
The scales for internal and external attribution are derived from existing literature, each containing items measuring attribution tendencies in service failure contexts.  
By integrating attribution theory, this research develops a framework to explain the impact on sustained trust and reveals the varying impacts of different factors on attribution.

【第113个问题：what is AI anxiety】
问题相关文本：Based on your request to extract all content specifically addressing "AI anxiety," here is the relevant text from the provided segments:

---

**Abstract:**  
"Furthermore, AI anxiety, as a cognitive characteristic of users, not only negatively impacts sustained trust but also significantly moderates the effect of internal attributions on sustained trust."

**Theoretical Framework:**  
"AI anxiety as the moderator. Robot anxiety, defined as a preexisting anxiety toward robots among users, is a relatively stable psychological trait. This anxiety does not stem from distrust in the robot’s capabilities but rather from the uncertainty and discomfort triggered by interacting with robots (Nomura et al. 2008). In research contexts involving AI robots (or chatbots), this is often referred to as AI anxiety (Johnson and Verdicchio, 2017). Such anxiety can occur in both real and imagined human-robot interaction scenarios, and in studies of human-robot interaction, anxiety toward AI robots is considered one of the significant reasons why people avoid artificial intelligence (Celik and Yesilyurt, 2013). In scenarios where AI chatbots are employed, extensive research has confirmed the negative effects of AI anxiety. For example, studies by Mende et al. demonstrated that anxiety leads to negative attitudes and distrust toward service robots (Mende et al. 2019), and Meyer et al. indicated that high levels of anxiety reduce users’ attitudes toward human-robot interactions (Meyer et al. 2020). Similarly, we hypothesize that similar effects caused by AI anxiety may also occur in our study; specifically, users with high levels of AI anxiety may have a lower willingness to sustain trust in AI chatbots in the context of service interaction failures, and it may inhibit the impact of internal attributions on sustained trust."

**Hypotheses:**  
"H5a: AI anxiety is negatively correlated with sustained trust in AI chatbots in the context of service failure.  
H5b: AI anxiety moderates the impact of internal attributions on sustained trust."

**Results:**  
"AI anxiety significantly reduces sustained trust ($\beta=-0.472$, $p=0.006$, $95\%$ Boot $\operatorname{CI}=[-0.595,\,-0.353]$), supporting H5a; it also significantly moderates the impact of internal attribution on continued trust $\beta=-0.208$, $p=0.000$, $95\%$ Boot $CI=[-0.282$, $-0.121]$). When individual AI anxiety levels are high $(+1\,\mathrm{SD})$, the impact of internal attribution on sustained trust is strong, whereas it is weak when AI anxiety levels are low $(-\mathsf{SD})$."

**Discussion and Conclusion:**  
"AI anxiety as the moderator. This research introduces AI anxiety, a cognitive perception, as both a direct influencing factor and a moderating variable. It was found that levels of AI anxiety not only directly reduce consumers’ willingness to maintain trust in AI customer service in the context of service failures but also exacerbate the negative impact of internal attributions on sustained trust. Specifically, consumers with higher levels of AI anxiety experience a more severe negative impact on their trust in AI chatbots due to internal attributions. Conversely, those with lower levels of AI anxiety exhibit a relatively mild negative impact on trust under similar circumstances. Consumers with high levels of AI anxiety tend to hold more negative and resistant attitudes toward AI systems. When service failures occur, these users are more likely to rely on stereotypical views of AI, leading to a more pronounced reduction in sustained trust. However, those with lower levels of AI anxiety, despite perceiving that the service failure may be due to internal factors of the AI, adopt a more tolerant attitude and thus experience a lesser impact on trust (Chuah and Yu, 2021).  
AI anxiety, as an individual psychological state, reflects consumers’ insecurity about artificial intelligence technology and concerns about potential negative consequences. This insecurity may stem from a lack of understanding of the technology, previous negative experiences, or negative media portrayals (Kaya et al. 2024). Therefore, brands employing AI chatbots must consider how to alleviate users’ AI anxiety, potentially by enhancing users’ AI literacy and improving communication transparency to increase understanding and trust in the technology (Su et al. 2023)."
